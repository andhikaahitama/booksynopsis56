With practical advice, tips and hints, the authors set out the various pastry, sponge and dough bases used for desserts and breads, and the creams and fruit-flavoured sauces that complement them. The main recipe section comprises Cold desserts and sweets, Hot desserts and sweets, Hot and cold fruit tarts, Ice creams and sorbets, Petits fours and canapes and finally Cakes.

His home was a remote Soviet agricultural station int he mountain range separting Turkmenistan from Iran. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, he found himself exiled from his hidden Eden and his collection of 1,117 pomegranates.Dr. Gregory Levin, a famed pomegrante scientist, devoted his life to studying the ruby fruit and preserving its biodiversity.

Written between 1957 and 1960, when Sturgeon and his family lived in both America and Grenada, finally settling in Woodstock, New York, these stories reflect his increasing preference for psychology over ray guns. Stories such as "The Man Who Told Lies," "A Touch of Strange," and "It Opens the Sky" show influences as diverse as William Faulkner and John Dos Passos. Always in touch with the zeitgeist, Sturgeon takes on the Russian Sputnik launches of 1957 with "The Man Who Lost the Sea," switching the scene to Mars and injecting his trademark mordancy and vivid wordplay into the proceedings. These mature stories also don't stint on the scares, as "The Graveyard Reader"&#x2014;one of Boris Karloff's favorite stories&#x2014;shows. Acclaimed novelist Jonathan Lethem's foreword neatly summarizes Sturgeon's considerable achievement here.</p><p>Theodore Sturgeon was born on February 26, 1918 in Staten Island, New York. He died in Eugene, Oregon, on May 8, 1985. A resident of New York City, upstate New York, and Los Angeles, he is the author of more than thirty novels and short story collections."Historically, the <i>Complete Sturgeon</i> is one of the most important reissues in years. In terms of reading, this is a goldmine both for those already familiar with Sturgeon's work and for a new generation of readers ready for something real."-<i>Strange Worlds Magazine</i>"Theodore Sturgeon has become a kind of patron saint of SF short story writers. His fiction demonstrated a love of humanity and an understanding of human emotion unparalleled in the field. At the time of his death in 1985, no short story writer was held in so high a regard."-David Brin, author of <i>Heaven's Reach </i></p><h2>Splash 1/America&#39;s Best Contemporary Watercolors</h2><p>Splash 1 shocases the work of 90 watercolor artists working in a wide range of styles and techniques--tight realism to loose abstraction, traditional transparent watercolor to various experimental techniques. 160 full-color illustrations.</p><p></p><h2>One Train Later: A Memoir</h2><p><i>"The train jerks to a halt, and as I get out at Oxford Circus, Stewart gets out with me. We look at each other, laugh, and make the standard remark about it being a small world. But this is the brilliant collision, one train later and it might all have turned out differently."</i>&nbsp;In this extraordinary memoir, world-renowned guitarist Andy Summers provides a revealing and passionate account of a life dedicated to music. From his first guitar at age thirteen and his early days on the English music scene to the ascendancy of his band, the Police, Summers recounts his relationships and encounters with the Big Roll Band, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, the Animals, John Belushi, and others, all the while proving himself a master of telling detail and dramatic anecdote.<br><br>But, of course, the early work is only part of the story, and Andy's account of his role as guitarist for the Police---a gig that was only confirmed by a chance encounter with drummer Stewart Copeland on a London train---has been long-awaited by music fans worldwide. The heights of fame that the Police achieved have rarely been duplicated, and the band's triumphs were rivaled only by the personal chaos that such success brought about, an insight never lost on Summers in the telling.<br>&nbsp;<br>Complete with never-before-published photos from Summers's personal collection, <i>One Train Later</i> is a constantly surprising and poignant memoir, and the work of a world-class musician and a first-class writer.</p><p>ANDY SUMMERS is a Grammy Award winner and an inductee in both the&nbsp;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Guitar Player Hall of Fame. He has followed his work with the Police with a career that encompasses more than twelve solo albums, soundtracks, and collaborations in addition to concerts and exhibitions of his photography around the world. He lives in California.One <br>I am born at the edge of the River Wyre in Lancashire, where my dad is stationed with the RAF in the north of England. Housing is in short supply and he makes the purchase of a Gypsy caravan. It is a romantic move, but one of necessity. My mother is known as Red; she is pregnant, and works in a bomb factory alongside a gang of northern girls called the Fosgene Follies. One day, in her ninth month, she becomes intoxicated by the fumes leaking from a faulty bomb and, having contractions, is carried back to the field where she lives with my dad. I come into this world a few hours later, and the queen of the Romany vagrants in the next field pays a visit to my mother. She hands over a small piece of silver, six eggs, and a piece of white linen&#x2014;all traditional gifts intended to bring a propitious future. Sitting on the floor with a pack of tarot cards and a meaningful look on her face, she looks up at the young flame-haired woman leaning back into the pillow with her baby and begins shuffling the cards. But Red, with her attraction to the occult still in place and me dangling from her nipple, struggles up and looks across expectantly. <br>Red gives up her job as a bomb packer, and as the war comes to an end my parents return to the south of England and the beaches of Bournemouth, with their huge rusting curlicues of barbed wire and lonely skeletal piers. I stand on the promenade, clutching my mother&#x2019;s hand as my dad explains to me through the biting wind that we have blown up the piers to prevent the Germans from getting onto our shore. My five-year-old brain is filled with hordes of helmeted men racing across the sand with thick stubby guns. Around the town are the ruins of several buildings, destroyed after the Luftwaffe dropped their remaining bombs before heading back over the Channel to Germany. What if one lands on your head? I wonder. Would you blow up? <br>Near our house on the outskirts of town is a large wooded area by the name of Haddon Hill. Filled with oak, pine, beech, chestnut, and birch that spread for miles, it becomes the arena of my childhood where other boys and I wrestle and fight in the dirt, throw stones at dogs, torture cats, start fires, steal birds&#x2019; eggs, and piss on flowers. Sometimes we find old boxes of gas masks and other wartime paraphernalia that have been guiltily dumped among the trees. We instantly put these things on and race off into the elms and oaks, howling at the top of our lungs. At the end of an afternoon with hours of ambush, screaming, and cruelty under our belts, we return home. As the evening stars emerge and the lampposts in the street begin to create their yellowish flare, we trail into our mothers&#x2019; kitchens looking like miniature versions of the home guard. With our gas mask tubes bouncing on our puny chests and sensible sweaters, we look upward to ask with a voice muffled by rubber tubing, &#x201c;Can I have something to eat, Mum?&#x201d; <br>The woods fill my imagination, because secretly I am a nature lover, something I don&#x2019;t betray to the other boys, and I become an expert on secret paths, trees with holes in them, owls&#x2019; nests, places where you can find slowworms and adders, the pale blue eggs of the chaffinch. <br>I scrawl weird signs in the dirt as if they contain hidden meaning, my keys to the whereabouts of a rookery or a dump of used wartime supplies. I spend every minute I can in this place until I feel as if I know every vein on every leaf, the knots in trees, where rolling waves of beetles race from under rotting logs and where the venom-filled adders lie in wait. The thick smell of decomposition pervades my senses like a perfume, and under the low-piled clouds I kick my way through dense leaves, used condoms, tea-colored ferns, and tossed Black Cat cigarette packs, wearing a vivid blue cloak because I am Captain Marvel. I find a fragment of a letter in the ferns, but all I can make out in the rain-smeared writing are the words Mike, it&#x2019;s been too long. And I become obsessed with a man called Mike. Who is he? Who wrote this letter? Where are they now? What happened? I stand at the local bus shelter with sheets of rain obscuring everything and stare at women in the queue, wondering if one of them is the one who wrote those words. <br>Between the ages of seven and twelve the overpowering sense of nature makes me feel drunk, and in a future filled with electricity, lights, and loud music, it will linger like a sanctifying echo, a chord I used to know. After my mother switches out the lights I sit in bed with the Dr. Doolittle books and read by holding back the curtain, which lets in the flickering light of the lamppost from the street below. Inspired by his adventures, I begin collecting birds&#x2019; eggs, lizard skins, flowers, grasses, and weirdly shaped rocks. I make careful notes about these objects and look them up in my Observer&#x2019;s books. I fancy myself as Doolittle junior, a son of nature strolling through long grass with a pipe in my mouth. I pore over books about plants and animals and take to making long lists of names, which I give dimension by gluing lizard skin, bird feathers, and dead flowers onto pieces of cardboard until my bedroom becomes a personal museum and acquires a slightly strange smell. <br>As I pull myself closer and closer to these things both living and dead, the world&#x2014;in my nascent imagination&#x2014;becomes alive and vivid. Now, as if for the first time, I see it teeming with natural events, a connection between all things, a web, the underlying soul. Animus mundi. <br>A tragic moment occurs at the age of nine, when discarding Marvel&#x2019;s blue cape, I move into a Lash LaRue phase. Lash is a popular Western hero and features in a popular comic I read from cover to cover every week. In every story he escapes dire situations through his incredible ability with a bullwhip or his lash&#x2014;hence the moniker. An inspiring figure, Lash dresses in black from head to toe, with a black eye mask and a broad stiff-rimmed black hat. With his whip and mask, he is the perfect embodiment of some kind of homoerotic fantasy that I am too young to comprehend. <br>Close to our house there is an apple orchard that contains a working beehive. Clothed in anything black I can find, and with my whip in hand, I decide one afternoon to see if I can emulate my hero by snaring the hive and pulling it to the ground. I creep through the long sun-dappled grass to spy on my target. Hiding behind a tree full of Granny Smiths, I calculate carefully. And then, raising the whip over my head like a king cobra, I strike and yell in triumph as the whip coils itself into a tight circle around the buzzing cone. I give it a strong tug and it crashes down, releasing about fifty million venomous and pissed-off bees that rise like a thick black cloud. I drop the whip and run like a man on fire, but they are faster and I am stung, pierced, and penetrated in every available piece of exposed flesh and through my lash outfit until I reach home, sobbing and panting with a face like a swollen river. &#x201c;Mum!&#x201d; I scream. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been stung! I&#x2019;ve been stung!&#x201d; <br>Stuck at home, the only diversions being reading or listening to the radio, I become a fan of a show that thrills me and many of my friends at school. It&#x2019;s called Journey into Space and has four protagonists: Jet, Lemmy, Mitch, and Doc. It&#x2019;s a serial that&#x2019;s on every Tuesday night at eight o&#x2019;clock. Heralded by the dramatic fanfare of a rocket blasting into space, a masculine voice intones the program title and we pick up from where we left off last week. Usually the heroes are having a problem such as a control malfunction as they attempt to travel to the moon, and we crouch on the floor in front of the coal fire listening bug-eyed as our heroes grapple with martians, alien monsters, or a failed retro-rocket. As the show comes to an end my mum is standing there with a mug of Horlicks, telling me to get up the apples and pears. Stoned on the last half hour of space, stars, and planets, I stare at her in incomprehension. But I climb the stairs, calling out good night, and slide into bed to follow the adventures of Dan Dare and the Mekon in the Eagle, the yellowing flare of the streetlight through the crack in the curtains giving just enough light to ruin my eyes. <br>From time to time in the dream of life that spins from four to eleven years of age, there are points of gold&#x2014;moments of completeness&#x2014;the happiest of these times being when my parents take me to the cinema to see the latest film. <br>In the hours before the event&#x2014;going to the pictures&#x2014;there is always a sense of excitement in the house. My father disappears to fill the car with petrol while my mother rattles around in the kitchen to see that we have dinner before we leave. The phrase &#x201c;What time does the big picture start?&#x201d; becomes a mantra in our family. Finally we close the front door behind us. My mother squeezes into the car next to me, a cloud of perfume powder and makeup; my dad turns the ignition; and we lurch away from the wet curb toward the Moderne cinema. The tight confines of the car and the intoxicating haze of perfume combine with the leather seats and the smell of petrol to make the drive a voluptuous and sacred ritual. <br>Along with this heavenly bouquet comes my craving for chocolate. The dark brown stuff fills my head like a dark sea of unending pleasure, and as we pass through rain-filled streets with my dad cursing the faulty heater and wiping his hand across a befogged windscreen, I fantasize about it, dream of it, and plan to have so much of it one day that I will laugh out loud as I eat myself into a chocoholic coma. <br>But life for many young couples in postwar Britain is difficult and my parents have problems. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so hard to make ends meet,&#x201d; my mother will often say, as she washes another dish or darns another sock, and my dad never seems to be home because he is always working. A huge row between them one day ends in the kitchen with my mother sobbing and me on the floor with my arms around her legs, screaming, &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t cry, Mummy, please don&#x2019;t cry.&#x201d; The tension of trying to survive has an eroding effect on their marriage, and it breaks down. My younger brother and I are put into an orphanage for six months. We never see our mother, but Dad visits us on the weekends. We live with other kids in the top room of a farmhouse building, where we sleep in two-tier bunks and ridicule one another with cruel remarks. My bunk lies near a window and through it I can see across several fields to a river in the distance, and as the stars climb into the sky I fall asleep with these rivers and meadows in my mind like a map to a beautiful place and I wonder if my mum will be there. One day Dad comes to collect us, telling us that she is back from the hospital and that it is time to go home. My brother and I ask him about the hospital, but he is vague and just mutters something about an operation. An hour later we are back in our own house with our own mother, who weeps and hugs us, and then we get on with teatime as if nothing had happened. <br>Through the bright and shadowed years of childhood the pop songs of the time&#x2014;&#x201c;Twenty Tiny Fingers (Twenty Tiny Toes),&#x201d; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a Pink Tooth Brush, I&#x2019;m a Blue Tooth Brush,&#x201d; or &#x201c;How Much Is That Doggie in the Window&#x201d;&#x2014;fill my head like a tinny pink-colored soundtrack: the optimism of a world now under the shadow of the bomb. As if in some premonitory act, I lie in bed giving imaginary solo concerts by making twanging guitar sounds with my mouth, although I have never seen a real guitar. Eventually my mother insists that I take piano lessons, and a small upright is purchased for the front room, where she sits at my side each night making sure that I go through my scales and five-finger exercises. <br>Every Thursday evening around five I walk down the avenue to the house of Mrs. Thorne, the local piano teacher, who is supposed to be good if a little eccentric. &#x201c;Practice, Andrew&#x2014;practice,&#x201d; my mum says, and I drag myself to the lesson, filled with a deep desire to take off into the woods at the end of the street and chuck my spear at something. Mrs. Thorne&#x2014;a throwback to Victorian England&#x2014;wears small wire-rimmed glasses and has her hair cut like an English schoolgirl with a clip in it; and to round it off, she wears long pink bloomers whose edges always poke out beneath the hemline of her skirts. She has a permanent cold&#x2014;or so it appears&#x2014;because she is forever sniffing and extracting a white hankie from her bloomers, blowing into it, and then stuffing it back into place. This act always faintly disgusts me&#x2014;I imagine a line of transparent snot like a snail trail up her leg. <br>I play children&#x2019;s exercises and an odd assortment of simple pieces. The highlight, and usually the grand finale of the lesson, comes when we play a duet on the song &#x201c;Wonderful Wonderful Copenhagen.&#x201d; I actually love this tune and don&#x2019;t mind playing it with the old dear because I&#x2019;ve seen the film, which stars Danny Kaye, and adore it. So I go at it with considerable gusto and not much finesse because it is on this one song that I feel I can actually play the piano; knowing this, she always saves it for the end of the lesson so that I can go home feeling less dour about the whole thing. <br>The room we play in reeks of mothballs and is filled with overstuffed armchairs and pictures of dogs; on the piano is a framed color photo of the queen. There is a rumor on the street that Mrs. Thorne has actually composed music for the coronation. This is impressive, and we all vaguely wonder what she&#x2019;s doing in our part of the world, seeing as how she has written music for royalty. <br>Mrs. Thorne&#x2019;s husband, who is a conductor for the Hants and Dorset bus line, skulks about in the background. He is a short, stubby man with dark greasy hair, a unibrow, and very thick glasses that look like the ends of a couple of beer bottles. <br>One lovely summer evening as I am shutting the front door after the lesson and about to walk home, Mr. Thorne appears on the path beside me. At first I think it is the garden gnome come to life but then realize it is the bus conductor. He smiles at me through stained English teeth and says, &#x201c;Come with me, I want to show you something.&#x201d; Innocent as the first day of spring, I skip down the path behind him in the direction of the potting shed at the bottom of the garden. <br>The shed, with its pots, tools, bags of fertilizer, and smell of earth, is typical of the English garden. Dark and claustrophobic, it is the perfect spot for an Agatha Christie murder. Maybe Mr. Thorne will show me some comics or a train set, I think, but after a little preamble of showing me the serrated edge of a hacksaw, he produces a large leather belt and asks me to whip him. &#x201c;Whip you?&#x201d; I say, my cornflower eyes wide and innocent as Bambi&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; He stares at me through his beer-bottle lenses and grunts something about deserving it and come on, be a good boy. I notice that his face is flushed, I don&#x2019;t understand it, but I also can&#x2019;t see anything wrong with it if that&#x2019;s what he wants. Mr. Thorne bends over the bench and asks me again with a small sob in his voice to give it to him. So with a puzzled idea in my head and a momentary glimpse of Lash LaRue, I let him have it. He tells me to do it harder, so I oblige, giving him a good half a dozen strokes, feeling like Captain Bluebeard in the process. Then he thanks me and I trot off home, dragging my hand through the hedges at the side of the road and whistling the Danny Kaye song and looking forward to beans on toast. The event recedes like a summer tide; I don&#x2019;t say anything to my parents or consider that I might put a man away for life but continue happily on thumping away at...</p><h2>Fit to Be Tied (The Sisters of Bethlehem Springs)</h2><p><p>It&#x2019;s 1916, and Idaho rancher Cleo Arlington knows everything about horses but nothing about men.

So is Statham, who&#x2019;s never encountered a woman succeeding in a &#x201c;man&#x2019;s world.&#x201d; Their bumpy trot into romance is frustrating, exhilarating, and ultimately heartwarming.</p></p><p><p>Robin Lee Hatcher is the author of 80 novels and novellas with over five million copies of her books in print.

Mrs. Bradley received her B.A. in 1964 from Hardin Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, then did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1965-67. <p> She was a science fiction/fantasy fan from her middle teens, and made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in <b>Fantastic/Amazing Stories</b> in 1949. She had written as long as she could remember, but wrote only for school magazines and fanzines until 1952, when she sold her first professional short story to <b>Vortex Science Fiction</b>.

Thus it has ever been." With this characterization of the inevitable cycle of Chinese history, the monumental tale Three Kingdoms begins. As important for Chinese culture as the Homeric epics have been for the West, this Ming dynasty masterpiece continues to be read and loved throughout China as well as in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The novel offers a startling and unsparing view of how power is wielded, how diplomacy is conducted, and how wars are planned and fought; it has influenced the ways that Chinese think about power, diplomacy, and war even to this day. <p>Three Kingdoms portrays a fateful moment at the end of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D.220) When the future of the Chinese empire lay in the balance.

Tessa, however, is thrilled with her situation, as it allows her to concentrate on her love of the arts--and no one in the Viennese opera company need know that their delightful and charming under-wardrobe mistress is really a princess. But when the dashing self-made millionaire Guy Farne arrives at the opera in search of suitable entertainment for his high society guests, Tessa realizes that there may be more to life--and love--than just music. But while the attraction between them in undeniable, Guy's insufferable snob of a fianc�e only solidifies Tessa's determination to keep her true identity a secret. Yet, after a chance meeting with the handsome Englishman, Tessa's reserve begins to melt, and she starts to wonder if it's not too late for a fairytale ending?<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Eva Ibbotson, born Maria Charlotte Michelle Wiesner (21 January 1925 &#x2013; 20 October 2010), was an Austrian-born British novelist, known for her children's books. Some of her novels for adults have been successfully reissued for the young adult market in recent years. For the historical novel Journey to the River Sea (Macmillan, 2001), she won the Smarties Prize in category 9&#x2013;11 years, garnered unusual commendation as runner up for the Guardian Prize, and made the Carnegie, Whitbread, and Blue Peter shortlists. She was a finalist for the 2010 Guardian Prize at the time of her death. Her last book, The Abominables, was one of eight books on the longlist for the same award in 2012.Grade 8 Up&#x2014;In post-World War I Austria, Englishman and self-made magnate Guy Farne buys a countryside castle as part of an elaborate plan to woo Nerine, the woman he loved and lost as a penniless teenager. Meanwhile Tessa, Pfaffenstein Castle's headstrong young heiress, revels in the anonymity of life as a junior wardrobe mistress at the International Opera Company in Vienna. When Guy commissions the company to stage a production of Mozart's <i>Magic Flute</i> at Pfaffenstein, he and Tessa meet and bond over their love of art and music. He is unaware of her connection to his new estate until her identity is revealed at a lavish ball held to introduce Nerine to Austrian society. Though drawn to Tessa, Guy stays faithful to his deliciously snobby fianc�e. In the meantime Tessa fields the dogged (and comic) marriage proposals of a local prince. Predictably, the star-crossed pair eventually get their well-deserved happy ending. The novel opens with too much telling instead of showing, but Ibbotson hits her stride once all the players assemble at the castle. Vivid details bring supporting characters to life. German phrases and literary allusions may escape young readers, but do not detract from the overall flow of the narrative. There is nothing groundbreaking here, but this is satisfactory historical romance for future fans of Philippa Gregory.&#x2014;<i>Amy Pickett, Ridley High School, Folsom, PA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To get lean, you have to be extreme...right? <br><br>Wrong. Dieting is a zero-sum game. You can lose weight fast, but more than a third of people regain all of the weight they've lost within a year. So why waste time following someone else's diet advice when you can drop the pounds on your <i>own </i>terms? With <i>Lose It! by </i>Charles Teague and Anahad O'Connor, the power to lose weight is in your hands. No deprivation, no detox, no hard-and-fast rules&#x2014;just a plan that empowers you to create your own, personalized strategy tailored to your individual lifestyle, schedule, dietary needs, and goals. <br><br>Despite what many "experts" would lead you to believe, weight loss boils down to simple math: calories in vs. calories out. To shed pounds, you have to end each day with a calorie deficit. It sounds easy enough, but studies show that 63 percent of Americans grossly underestimate their daily calorie intake. In fact, the average American consumes a staggering 3,790 calories a day&#x2014;that's enough calories to gain more than 10 pounds every month! <br><br><i>Lose It!</i>'s life-changing philosophy and program have already helped more than 5 million people lose weight. In this, the first-ever book to be developed from an iPhone app, readers will learn the five pillars of the Lose It! strategy: <br><br><b>1. Embrace mindful empowerment: </b>Take control of your body and the foods you put in it. <br><br><b>2. Track your calories:</b> There are no points or complicated algorithms to follow. But every snack, taste, and bite counts! <br><br><b>3. Track your habits.</b> Spot behavior patterns&#x2014;good and bad&#x2014;that you can modify to help you meet your goal. <br><br><b>4. Track your exercise.</b> Learn how to burn more calories in less time and boost your calorie burn even when you're not at the gym. <br><br><b>5. Benefit from peer support. </b>Your social network inspires you, keeps you accountable, and provides insight and advice. <br><br>With <i>Lose It!,</i> you can forget about following someone else's idea of what you should and shouldn't eat and simply learn to love food again.

He has appeared on NPR, Good Morning America, and The Martha Stewart Show. He lives in New York City.Chapter One<br><br>Mindful Empowerment<br><br>Calories Unmasked<br><br>For many years, we've been taught that in order to lose weight we have to learn to live without the foods we love. To get lean, you have to be extreme . . . right?<br><br>Wrong. Scientific research consistently shows that this approach doesn't work--and your epic battle with the bathroom scale proves it. Dieting is a zero-sum game. You can lose weight fast by cutting out certain foods and learning to live with cravings, but more than one-third of people on typical diets regain all of the weight they lose within a year. Long-term studies of Americans who've dropped 30 or more �ds and have kept it off for a minimum of 1 year--and in some cases, decades--offer proof that drastic change is not the answer. The people who are able to lose weight and maintain their weight loss successfully aren't following 30-day diet plans or subscribing to meal delivery services. They don't eliminate carbs or fat, and they certainly don't skip meals.<br><br>They all follow a strategy that worked long before the Era of the Diet, and one that will work long after the last fad diet is gone.<br><br>They reduce calories and they exercise.<br><br>If this bit of information doesn't come as a surprise to you, then here's something that might: You can do it, too. Lose It! will help you reach your health and fitness goals, and if you ask any one of the millions of people who've already benefited from this revolutionary weight-loss tool, they'll attest to the fact that you don't have to suffer for your success. If nothing gives you more satisfaction than a pillow-soft loaf of bread fresh from the oven (like quite a few Lose It! users), then don't give up your beloved carbs! If a hot dog with the works is your ultimate weakness, no one's going to stop you from indulging.<br><br>There are millions of reasons why Lose It! will work for you--about 6 million, in fact. That's because more than 6 million people have used the program since its inception. Each one has been able to create a personalized plan, tailored to his or her unique schedule, lifestyle, dietary needs, and food preferences. Lose It! simply empowers them with knowledge--the knowledge of how many calories they should be eating and how many calories they really are eating. This knowledge gives them (and you) the power to make small changes that add up to major losses.<br><br>The best possible weight-loss plan, after all, is the one that you design yourself. Just ask Brian Newby of Florida, who cycled on and off of the Atkins Diet for years, struggling to stay on the plan because he simply couldn't say no to bread. (For Brian, an Alabama native, a meal isn't a meal if it doesn't come with biscuits.) Then Brian discovered Lose It! After a year of following the program dutifully, he's lost more than 100 �ds--and he didn't have to give up the carbs he loves. Another Lose It! pro, Blaine Smelscer of Texas, shrunk himself from 280 �ds down to 180-- without giving up the hot dogs, burgers, and chicken fingers that form the foundation of his diet. He simply learned how to adjust his portion sizes and choose burgers, dogs, and chicken with fewer calories.<br><br>With Lose It!, you can forget about following someone else's idea of what you should and shouldn't eat and simply learn to love food again. One of the first things you'll discover is how to calculate a calorie budget that reflects your specific needs. When you stay within its limits, you're in the Green Zone. But when you eat more calories than you've budgeted for a day, you will enter the Red Zone--dangerous territory. It's similar to your financial budget. When you see how much you're spending on your choices (some of them regrettable), you'll learn to plan ahead and spend wisely. The end result? You'll spend on the things you really want--and stay in the green.<br><br>"I'm teaching myself to eat better," said Sabrina Euton, who lives in Georgia and has lost more than 40 �ds since January of 2010. "I know it's called Lose It!, but for me it's a tool that I use to teach myself to treat my body better. I can't tell you the last time I ate fast food. I used to pick up food on the way home from work all the time. Now I buy food and portion it into individual servings so I'm able to come home, pull out one container, and heat it up. I'm still eating things I want to eat. I'm just scheduling and preparing them ahead of time. My husband and I don't have that last-minute, 'What are we going to have for dinner?' fight anymore. Our local pizza shop was always the winner of that fight. They knew us by our first names."<br><br>THINK ECONOMICALLY, NOT JUDGMENTALLY<br><br>From now on, what you choose to eat is between you and your taste buds. A study by Tufts University scientists, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed that people who followed weight-loss plans that they didn't perceive as being too restrictive lost more weight and lowered their risk of developing cardiovascular diseases more than those who felt deprived. Simply put, the freedom to eat the foods you like can mean the difference between keeping the �ds off for good and finding yourself shopping for the next size up in a few short months.<br><br>When you consider that 70 percent of Americans surveyed in a 2010 study said that they were concerned about their weight, and nearly 80 percent said that they wanted to either lose or maintain their weight, the nationwide need for a little food freedom becomes more than clear.<br><br>But here's the scary part: Most Americans have no idea how many calories they're consuming and where those calories are going! The same 2010 study-- carried out by the International Food Information Council Foundation--found that only 12 percent of Americans could correctly estimate the number of calories they should be consuming in a day based on their age, weight, height, and activity level. And nearly half of all Americans have no idea how many calories they burn in a day.<br><br>It's not that they aren't trying to eat less and burn more. A majority of Americans say that to lose the weight, they're changing the amount of food they eat and the amount of time they spend being active. But making those changes without any knowledge of the amount of calories you need and the amount of calories you're burning daily is like driving across the country without a map. There's a chance you'll reach your destination, but there's also a chance you'll take a wrong turn and end up in Seattle when you were shooting for San Diego.<br><br>The premise of the plan is simple: The more you know about the number of calories you need to burn to reach your target weight and the number of calories that are in the foods you like to eat, the smarter the choices you make will be. To lose weight without depriving yourself, you need to know precisely how many calories you can afford to spend. When you ignore this basic information, the calories add up faster than you can say, "spare tire."<br><br>You wouldn't walk into Saks Fifth Avenue and buy a coat off the rack without peeking at the price tag, would you? And you certainly wouldn't take that coat to the register without having a rough idea of what's in your bank account. Yet most Americans go on a caloric spending spree every time they open up their fridge or walk into a sandwich shop.<br><br>ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST<br><br>Even if you think you're pretty careful about what you eat, there's a good chance you're consuming more calories than you realize. A 2006 study by scientists at Cornell University and published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that the more food you have on your plate, the more likely you are to underestimate the number of calories it contains (in some cases, by as much as 40 percent!). Tack onto that all of the little snacks and bites you sneak between meals each day, and it's no wonder the weight won't take a hike.<br><br>Yup, that's right. Those little bites add up, and they affect us all--the parents who finish their kids' mac 'n' cheese and uneaten chicken nuggets, the stealthy snacker who sneaks a spoonful of ice cream every night before bed, the sampler who always grabs those bite-size bits of free muffins at the local coffee shop, and even the human garbage disposal who makes a habit of putting away those last bites of hamburger or cheese lasagna that his friends have left stranded on their plates.<br><br>Plate Cleaning, Parenting Pounds, Sneaky Snacks, and Small Bites--They All Add Up!</p><h2>World History Biographies: Marco Polo: The Boy Who Traveled the Medieval World (National Geographic World History Biographies)</h2><p>In a life of ceaseless exploration, Marco Polo pushed out the borders of his narrow medieval world. <br><br>Born in Venice in 1254, the young Marco Polo first met his father at age 15, when the elder Polo returned from a trading expedition to the East.

Bess made it because she understood one of the basic principles of the newspaper business--everyone has a story. You have only to discover it and tell it well. <br><br> "She will tell you in this book about meeting interesting people. You will learn that there are few more interesting than Bess Scott herself."&#x2014;William P. Hobby <br><br> At the age of twenty-five, Bess Whitehead Scott became the first woman reporter for the city desk of the <i>Houston Post</i>. The year was 1915.<br><br> The author's memoir of the first ninety-seven years of her life illustrates how determination, courage, hard work, and caring family and friends propelled her past enormous obstacles, including poverty and a hearing impairment. Born near Blanket, Texas, in 1890, she grew up on a small farm held together by her widowed mother and eight brothers and sisters. Scott graduated from Baylor University and taught school briefly before she persuaded the Post editors to give her a chance. Her success led to other jobs in the then-unnamed field of public relations. Then, even before the filming of the silent movie classic, <i>Birth of a Nation</i>, she went to the little film colony called Hollywood, to try her hand at writing "scenarios."<br><br> Fame and fortune kept their distance from Bess Scott, but she did encounter many individuals whose fame, or infamy, whose friendship or failures made a deep impression on her. Clark Gable and Lyndon Johnson were her friends; her best friend, Lila Danforth, was always there during rough times when her marriage failed and she had to support her two small children by double moonlighting to supplement her meager earnings as a reporter. The opportunities and rights of women, the handicapped, and single, working mothers that are today taken for granted did not exist for Bess Whitehead Scott's mother or for her. Their talents and stamina in fighting rural and urban hardships exemplify a century of women's progress and highlight the roles played by the "interesting" people strung along the thread of their lives.<br><br></p><p>Bess Whitehead Scott has been a teacher, reporter, publicist, ad agency executive, freelance writer, and lecturer in her seventy-five-year career. She lives in Austin and has no plans to retire.High moments in the life of nonagenarian Scott, the first woman to break into newspaper work in Texas, unfold lackadaisically in this relaxed, somewhat humdrum memoir. Born in rural Texas in 1890 and raised with eight siblings on a farm by her widowed mother, Scott enjoyed a childhood "filled with love and security and simple pleasures" but also marred by poverty and recurrent illness. She graduated from Baylor University in Houston, and in 1915 launched her career as a reporter at the Houston Post : "I wanted to be the best ." Though spending most of her professional life at that paper, Scott also worked sporadically in public relations and as a screenwriter in the fledgling movie business in Hollywood ("I marvel now at my failure to perceive the impact the growing film industry would have on the nation"). A failed marriage and single motherhood seemed to increase her determination to succeed. Presenting herself as a pioneer but not a crusader, the author will gain respect for her accomplishments, but her pedestrian writing style will deter many readers.

Reprint. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>This walking tour ends, literally, at a jumping-off place. It ends, too, at the end of the world. Kathryn Davis's beautifully written tale begins and ends in Wales, a country she would have us believe is looped and configured with myths that govern modern life as well as they did in the days of yore. Four Americans--two couples--make a trip there at the end of the 20th century. By journey's end, two of the four will disappear in a mist on the Gower peninsula. Years later, Susan, the daughter of one of the couples, cobbles their story together from diaries, court documents, and letters. The novel teeters between the Wales of the walking tour and the gray, mysterious, post-Apocalyptic world she endures.<p> Davis is very funny, in the English-country-house comedy-of-manners tradition--on the tour itself, making free with the unsavory combination of precious historicizing and raw sexual tension that characterizes such holidays. And she may well have a thing about vegetarians, who are well represented. "St. David's? Most Welsh churches seemed to be named for him, a man who subsisted on leeks and water and caused a hill to grow under his feet so he could address his disciples from a lofty position, more or less in the spirit of modern-day vegetarians." The satire jostles along nicely, full of prickly insults and off-balance observations.</p><p> Bobby Rose and Coleman Snow, the two husbands, run a company, SnowWhite &amp; RoseRead, that has invented a kind of overwriting device, a computer program that detects vulnerability in texts and allows readers to rewrite them. This program may or may not have precipitated a kind of holocaust of meaning, where Susan is forced to dwell now that her parents have quit the scene. If this all sounds a little vague, it is. In retrospect, Susan muses, "But how did it work, I wonder? By which I mean, morally, not technically. What came over people that they'd let other people fool around with their words, their sentences, their ideas, their dreams?" Dunno, but at a certain point, one starts to wonder how it worked technically, not morally. Don't expect a punch-line, end-of-novel answer, for it never comes. Davis hangs a huge amount of millennial, late-capitalist baggage from this invention, and yet we never properly find out what exactly it is. You can make out the kernel, just barely, within the mist. But the mist starts to give you a headache, and you yearn to get back to the really rather good yarn of the four people going for a walk in Wales. On the other hand, a headachy mist is just the effect Davis seems to be after in her fourth novel. For readers seeking to be unmoored, this is a heady, misty read indeed. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Davis's fourth and thoroughly engaging novel (after <i>Hell</i>) is a witty blend of genres: mystery, courtroom drama, futuristic tale and a reworking of Welsh myth. In some unspecified year in the 21st century, when ideologies have transformed to the point where "the whole idea of edge... [has]... become a thing of the past," Susan R. Rose hides away on Maine's coast, in what was once her family home, reconstructing the events that led to her mother's disappearance and certain death during a walking tour through Wales, when Susan was 13. Equipped with letters and cards sent by her mother, a famous painter; a stack of unlabeled photos; a transcript from a wrongful death suit; and a laptop notebook her mother's oldest friend (and deepest rival) kept, Susan pieces together the spats, jealousies and sudden couplings of the tourists on a pilgrimage. Although she is at first alone, Susan's privacy is invaded by Monkey, a boy encamped nearby. He's a Strag, a member of a futuristic culture that is propertyless and thus lawless, "a triumph of the virtual." As in any good mystery, several possible suspects emerge with a variety of reasons to have killed Carole Ridingham Rose (even Monkey could hold a clue), yet Davis manages to keep this plot line alive while ingeniously weaving her imaginative settings. The playfulness of Davis's writing is irresistible. Laced with fairy tales, neologisms and poems, her prose is clever, sometimes dazzling, skating lightly over complex ideas that otherwise might bog down the narrative. Looking at an Andy Warhol painting, Susan's father says to her mother, "I like it. It's like money; it skips the middle step." One insistent theme surfacing in this highly original novel is the relationships between property and morality, between time and space. Davis's take on these subjects is intellectually rigorous, while the suspense remains satisfyingly taut. Author tour. (Nov.) Copyright 1999</p><h2>The Life and Times of Menachem Begin</h2><p>Documented by in-depth research into Begin&#39;s family origins in Poland, his Holocaust experiences and his years as a guerrilla leader in Palestine, this biography draws together the threads of Begin&#39;s life and career in Israeli politics</p><p>The last few years have seen a flood of personal and "official" assessments of Begin's life and times. No wonder, since Begin has done everything to cloak his own past in mysterious and vague terms. Perlmutter ( Israel: the partitioned state ), a political scientist who knows well the history of Zionism and Israel, has written the first serious biography of Begin. He relies on documentation and evidence, though he also makes full use of oral history. The book traces Begin from his early days in Poland to his last days as prime minister of Israel. It explores the complexity of the man and tries to uncover what lies behind the public facade. Perlmutter obviously has a good grasp on how to write biography. The subtitle of Temko's book indicates that it is a "personal" portrait, and indeed that is so in both meanings of the term. The book concentrates on Begin's personal life, and it is written from a personal point of view, as Temko tries to unravel Begin as a human man and political actor. The author is less familiar with the larger story of Zionism and Israel. The book is based on published sources and many interviews, quite a few of them with Begin's friends and even some with members of his family. Like Perlmutter's book it is well written, but Perlmutter's should be the first choice for most libraries.Jehuda Reinharz, Near Eastern &amp; Judaic Studies Dept., Brandeis Univ., Waltham, Mass.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Perlmutter (Israel: The Partitioned State, etc.) has written a tedious, repetitious, political biography of the controversial former Israeli prime minister. Despite a strong, self-admitted ideological bias against his subject, he takes a sympathetic approach to demythologize Begin: "He over the years, has been labeled a Fascist, a threat to Israeli democracy and a militarist, but in fact he was a democrat, a liberal and a parliamentary politician . . . a man of high moral standards . . . committed to justice." Perlmutter also maintains that Begin was, repeatedly, a victim of passivity during crises, and that as a young man, he "was a classic . . . party apparatchik . . . with few original ideas of his own." The author makes some sound points, but they are imbedded in a confusing history of political intrigue and often are accompanied by speculation (for example, on Begin's feelings toward his mentor Vladimir Jabotinsky and rival Ben-Gurion, he writes: "Deep in his heart, Begin believed he never quite measured up to either man").

Volume I chronicled a chain of disasters through the fall of France to the debacle in Greece; this second volume chronicles great naval victories, El Alamein and the landings in North Africa. <p>The book contract was signed with a London publisher in 1972. Volume I (publ. 1987) attracted critical acclaim, sold 20,000 copies, and was widely translated. Major publishers in the UK and USA issued editions. Volume II appears 14 years later after an uneasy birth. During the 30 years of its writing the world has turned; the halls of historical research now tremble to the tread of political correctness. This work's author finds himself no longer the celebrated subject of reviewers. Major publishers who still aspire to print his works come under assault from international bodies. In July 1992 - even as he was returning from the KGB archives in Moscow with the secret Goebbels Diaries - the directors of Macmillan Ltd. were being forced to the secret decision to burn all stocks of his remaining works. </p><p>This work benefits however from the release of thousands of secret files. At the author's request both the John Major and Tony Blair governments opened files previously sealed: thus we know more about Anthony Eden's role in the murder of Admiral Darlan. </p><p>The human side of Winston Churchill reaches boldly out of these pages - lively, incorrigible, and sometimes callous; hectoring his ministers, but meek and subservient to Moscow and Washington. The picture of him that emerges in Real History is sometimes unpalatable - willingly fomenting and prolonging the war against Hitler, not in pursuit of any fundamental British interest but to acquire, consolidate, and enjoy power and its fruits after years spent in the political wilderness and relative poverty; he appears undismayed by the ruin of the British empire. In two appendices Mr. Irving reveals that Roosevelt and Churchill maintained top secret communications channels to exchange messages that are still not released to the public. Hardbound, 40 pages of black and white and color plates, 1072 pages.</p></p><p>A professional historian of noted distinction, David Irving has researched and written about the Third Reich with passionate insight for many years. His first book, 'The Destruction of Dresden', was just one of several startling international bestsellers, which include 'Churchill's War' and 'Hitler's War'. The son of a Royal Navy commander, he was Educated at Imperial College of Science &amp; Technology and at University College London. He spent a year in Germany working in a steel mill, perfecting his fluency in the language. Among his thirty books, the best known include 'Hitler's War'; 'The Trail of the Fox: The Life of Field-Marshal Rommel'; 'Accident, the Death of General Sikorski'; 'The Rise and Fall of the Luftwaffe', Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich'; 'Nuremberg: The Last Battle'; and 'Goering: a Biography'. He has also translated several works by other authors. He lives in London and is the father of five daughters. He maintains an extensive website, updated daily, dealing with both historical and current events, commenting in his uniquely British way on all matters of import.David Irving, a remarkable researcher, a brilliant discoverer of documents, and a skillful writer, tells the story well. --Hugh Trevor-Roper<br><br>Irving's research is awsome! --Chicago Tribune<br><br>Irving's research is awsome! --Chicago Tribune</p><h2>Power Down (A Dewey Andreas Novel)</h2><p><p><i>Introducing Ben Coes--a major new thriller writer in the vein of Vince Flynn and Brad Thor--and an electrifying character, Dewey Andreas </i><br><i></i><br><i></i>A major North American hydroelectric dam is blown up and the largest off-shore oil field in this hemisphere is destroyed in a brutal, coordinated terrorist attack.

Its purpose is to guide us in becoming teachers of God through demonstration. In one way or another, each section is about learning how to accomplish this. This line-by-line presentation of the manual is organized around two major themes and variations of these two themes, thus demonstrating through the use of this musical form the masterful way in which Jesus weaves together his message. The first theme unifies all of the seemingly disparate questions posed in the manual&#x2014;that of separate versus shared interests. This theme is the core of the Course&#x2019;s concept of forgiveness. It is what makes healing possible, and is also the basis of the important topic in the text: the distinction between form and content. It emphasizes that we are all the same, reflecting the much larger theme of the Oneness of God&#x2019;s Son, and his perfect unity with his Creator and Source. The second theme is equally important&#x2014;in fact, it would not be possible to learn that our interests are shared without it. It is the key to the practice of the Course: asking the Holy Spirit for help. By asking help of our inner Teacher, we become aware of our wrong-minded thought system. In what the Course refers to as our right mind, the Holy Spirit gently corrects our misperceptions.</p><p></p><h2>Meno (Dover Thrift Editions: Philosophy)</h2><p>What is virtue? Can it be learned&nbsp;or is it innate? Is it possible to know things a priori (before experience)? In this important and influential Socratic dialogue, Plato addresses a wealth of philosophy's fundamental questions, including the difference between actually knowing something and merely maintaining a correct belief about it.<br> The dialogue begins when Meno, a young aristocrat from Thessaly, confidently declares that he can define virtue&#x2014;only to be reduced in short order to utter confusion, a fate common to those engaging in debate with Socrates. Meno's contention that a concept cannot be defined without knowledge of its nature leads to one of the most celebrated passages in the history of philosophy: Socrates asserts the doctrine of reincarnation, and by posing a mathematical puzzle to Meno's slave, demonstrates the existence of innate knowledge. This brief but profound dialogue, which forms the basis for subsequent examinations of a priori knowledge, appears here in the translation by the distinguished scholar Benjamin Jowett.</p><p>Plato ranks among the most familiar ancient philosophers, along with his teacher, Socrates, and his student, Aristotle. In addition to writing philosophical dialogues &#x2014; used to teach logic, ethics, rhetoric, religion, and mathematics as well as philosophy &#x2014; he founded Athens' Academy, the Western world's first institution of higher learning.</p><h2>10 Little Penguins: A Pop-Up Book</h2><p><p>This inventive pop-up, featuring the mischievous stars of Jean-Luc Fromental and Jo�lle Jolivet&#x2019;s <i>365 Penguins</i>, starts with ten penguins on an icy shore.

Just when he decides the doctor is crazy, the boy looks through the glasses and sees what he's been missing (almost everyone and everything in the world wearing glasses). Smith's illustrations are as offbeat as his work in Scieszka's The True Story of the Three Little Pigs (Viking, 1989). His text is just as wacky, and reflects a young boy's resistance not only to the idea of wearing glasses, but also to the optometrist's efforts to fit him. The page layout features different colors and typefaces at every turn. Unfortunately, it's sometimes difficult to read the print on a dark page. A fun romp that's more irreverent than Brown's Arthur's Eyes (Joy St/Little, 1979) or Keller's Cromwell's Glasses (Greenwillow, 1982), and one that just might give the people at the counter at LensCrafters some ammunition for the next youngster who doesn't want to look like a dork. --Christine A. Moesch, Buffalo and Erie County Public Library, Buffalo, NY<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this visually sophisticated look at a boy who assertively debates with a doctor who points out that he needs glasses, the mildly witty text is secondary to a wonderful series of out-of- focus illustrations of various visages equipped with specs: not just Mom, Sis, inventors, and `' `monster-movie' stuntpeople,'' but pink elephants, planets, and potatoes. The real clincher is not the list but the glasses themselves: on the last spread, everything finally comes clear. The idea may be limited, but the accompanying illustrations are comical and composed with remarkable skill. Offbeat but fascinating. (Picture book. 3+) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

I threatened to give her his home address and that shut him up.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I hate to tell you kids how to run your business, but you really need to have someone up there during business hours. It&#x2019;s no wonder you have hardly any clients. You need a full-time receptionist.&#x201d; She patted my arm. &#x201c;Yes, I know, dear, you&#x2019;re the receptionist, but you&#x2019;re always flitting off, doing God-knows-what. I could&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, my cell phone&#x2019;s vibrating,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;Could be a client. I&#x2019;ll talk to Paige about drop-ins.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no bother, dear. I wanted to speak to you anyway. I think I have a job for you.&#x201d; Tina lowered her voice, though we were the only ones in the lobby. &#x201c;I started dating this man. A widower I met online.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And you want me to run a background check? Good idea.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, no. A man has the right to his privacy. It&#x2019;s just . . . Well, I was watching this show on private investigators, about a firm of women hired by other women to test their mate&#x2019;s loyalty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It took me a second to catch her drift. &#x201c;You want me to try to seduce your boyfriend?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Her lips pursed. &#x201c;Certainly not. Just get dolled up, talk to him, flirt with him, and see whether he&#x2019;ll flirt back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m probably half his age. I&#x2019;d be worried if he <i>didn&#x2019;t </i>flirt back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A muffled snort made me glance down the hall. A guy a couple of years older than me leaned out of the stairwell doorway. Light hair just past his collar, denim jacket, boots, and a pair of snug-fitting worn blue jeans. He lifted a finger to his lips, shushing me, and I tried not to stare even if he was definitely stare-worthy.<br>&nbsp;<br>I turned back to Tina. &#x201c;That guy who wanted to speak to Lucas. Did you let him in?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Certainly not.&#x201d; She lowered her voice. &#x201c;He looked a little dodgy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Was he in his midtwenties? Dark blond hair? Looks like he lost contact with his razor a few days ago?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The guy arched his brows, mock-indignant.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s him,&#x201d; Tina said. &#x201c;Now about my job offer . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Spend the money on a shopping spree at Victoria&#x2019;s Secret and make sure he&#x2019;s too exhausted to look at twenty-year-olds.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Before she recovered from that suggestion, I took off.<br>&nbsp;<br>The guy waited until she was safely in her office, then strolled to meet me.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Dodgy?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the one wanting a hot chick to try seducing my new boyfriend.&#x201d; He extended his hand. &#x201c;Jesse Aanes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;d heard of him. A half-demon PI out of Seattle who&#x2019;d worked with Lucas a few times. Lucas said he was a good guy, which was the only seal of approval I needed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What brings you to Portland?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Cases. One that I&#x2019;m working now and a new one I wanted to run past Lucas. Two birds, one stone. I left him a message, but he hasn&#x2019;t returned it, which isn&#x2019;t like him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s on vacation with Paige. I confiscated their cell phones and the only messages I&#x2019;m passing on are well wishes and death notices.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He laughed. &#x201c;Good idea. They can use the break. Did that woman say Adam isn&#x2019;t around either?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s at a conference. It&#x2019;s just me for the rest of the week.&#x201d;<br><br>Jesse hesitated and I knew what he was thinking&#x2014;he needed help, but I wasn&#x2019;t what he had in mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you come up to the office,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Tell me what you&#x2019;ve got.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I used my key card to unlock the stairwell door. Yes, we have key card entry everywhere, plus a shitload of protective spells for the second floor. I undid them under my breath as we walked.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Tina said, we don&#x2019;t get a lot of drop-in clients. We don&#x2019;t want to. While we rarely turn away paying human customers, our clientele is almost exclusively supernatural and they don&#x2019;t need an ad in the Yellow Pages to find us. Given that Lucas is heir to the Cortez Cabal, though, not everyone who finds us wants to hire us. Hence the heavy security.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jesse followed me up the stairs. &#x201c;I guess the daughter of Eve Levine and Kristof Nast doesn&#x2019;t need to worry about strangers attacking her in an empty office.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If they do, I can always use them for my next ritual sacrifice. Volunteers are so hard to come by.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s not the sort of crack you should make when you have a notorious dark witch for a mother and an equally notorious cutthroat sorcerer for a father. It was a test of sorts, and Jesse passed, just laughing and saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll watch my step then.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s your power? I know you&#x2019;re a half-demon.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Agito.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Telekinesis, then. Agito was the second of the three levels, meaning he had mediocre abilities. Having dealt with a high-level Volo before, I was much more comfortable with an Agito.<br>&nbsp;<br>His powers explained how he&#x2019;d snuck past Tina. Using telekinesis, he&#x2019;d caught the door before it closed. I&#x2019;d have to talk to Lucas about that. Yet another argument against human tenants.<br>&nbsp;<br>I led Jesse into the meeting room. He didn&#x2019;t sit down&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t even take off his jacket&#x2014;just strode straight to the table and pulled files from his satchel.<br>&nbsp;<br>He set a crime-scene photo on the table. &#x201c;Six months ago, two young women were murdered in Columbus, Washington, about an hour over the Oregon border. I doubt it made the Portland news. Nothing all that hinky about the killings. No sign of a serial killer or sexual sadism. Just the shooting death of two twenty-five-year-olds who led the kind of lives where you sort of figure, sooner or later&#x201d;&#x2014;he gestured at the photo of the two women&#x2014;&#x201c;this is how they&#x2019;re going to end up.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hookers?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He shook his head. &#x201c;Just not exactly sterling members of society.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Drugs?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Booze? Petty crime? All of the above?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You got it. Nothing you haven&#x2019;t seen a million times before. I was on that path myself until Lucas got me out of some trouble and persuaded me there were legal ways to use my skills. Anyway, these girls didn&#x2019;t run into a Lucas. They were high school dropouts. Never held a job more than a few months. One had a kid at sixteen. Both had short rap sheets, and a string of boyfriends with longer ones.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I lifted the photo to take a closer look. The two bodies lay on a floor. Both were fully dressed, T-shirts covered in blood, each bearing a hole. Single gunshot wounds to the chest. One was on her back, eyes open, arms akimbo, legs twisted, a pool of blood under her. The other was stretched out, arms and legs only slightly bent, eyes closed. The blood under her was smeared.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Both shot, as you see,&#x201d; Jesse said. &#x201c;A through-and-through for the first, the bullet apparently lodging in the wall over there.&#x201d; He pointed to the edge of the photo. &#x201c;They recovered another bullet from inside the second victim. The first one died immediately. The second didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t look like she tried to get away, though. Drugged?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have tox screens.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No sign of rape or torture, like you said. Looks execution style. A classic case of &#x2018;Hey, bitch, you gonna pay for that dope or what?&#x2019; The answer, apparently, being &#x2018;or what.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yep, that&#x2019;s what it looks like.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>When he didn&#x2019;t go on, I glanced at him. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s your interest? Is one of these girls a supernatural?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Not as far as I know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He set a second photo on the table. It was another murdered young woman, also early twenties, though one glance told me <i>this </i>girl didn&#x2019;t sell herself for dime bags.<br>&nbsp;<br>I put the two photos side by side. All three bodies had been left in the same place.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Basement?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Of an abandoned building.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I could hear Lucas&#x2019;s voice. <i>The fact that the deceased are found in a common location may speak less to a connection than to a simple matter of convenience</i>. Yes, Lucas really did talk that way. Drove me nuts, especially when I found myself slipping into the same speech patterns. On the plus side, I may not be an A student, but I sure as hell can sound like one.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I told Jesse my theory&#x2014;small town, not a lot of places to put a body, someone had already used this one, so the second killer followed suit&#x2014;he shrugged. &#x201c;Possible, but in this particular small town, there&#x2019;s no shortage of abandoned buildings.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the local murder rate?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking at it. This double killing last fall, then the single one ten days ago. Before that, the last homicide was a domestic incident in 1999.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Lot of drug activity in town?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It has its share, maybe a little more. You can blame that on a depressed economy, though. It&#x2019;s not exactly a hotbed of gangsta activity. Mostly kids selling pot from their lockers, the laid-off guy down the road dealing out of his garage, that sort of thing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Do the police think it&#x2019;s the same killer for all three?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yep, but only because otherwise they&#x2019;d need to catch two murderers, and that&#x2019;s more work than they care to contemplate.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to make me guess what the supernatural connection is, aren&#x2019;t you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I was just seeing if you&#x2019;d pick it up. It&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I lifted a hand to cut him off. &#x201c;Is the answer here?&#x201d; I asked, pointing at the photos.<br>&nbsp;<br>He nodded.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Give me a minute.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>After the Flood: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>An inventive and riveting epic saga, <em>After the Flood </em>signals the arrival of an extraordinary new talent.</strong> </p><p>A little more than a century from now, our world has been utterly transformed.

Then, in a violent confrontation with a stranger, Myra suddenly discovers that Row was last seen in a far-off encampment near the Artic Circle. Throwing aside her usual caution, Myra and Pearl embark on a perilous voyage into the icy northern seas, hoping against hope that Row will still be there.</p><p>On their journey, Myra and Pearl join forces with a larger ship and Myra finds herself bonding with her fellow seekers who hope to build a safe haven together in this dangerous new world.

His debut book, <i>Fargo Rock City</i>, was the winner of the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award. He has written for <i>GQ, Esquire</i>, <i>The New York Times Magazine, Spin, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Believer, A.V.

A specialist in inconsequence, he writes glibly about the passing scene in clever phrases. This volume includes profiles of celebrities, opinion pieces, and a smattering of short fiction. His vocal skill is less felicitous than his writing. On the positive side, he adopts a light, chatty tone and a brisk pace that nicely complement his text. He does have some flair as a raconteur. But his scratchy voice grates on this reviewer's nerves, as does his sloppy diction and air of in-crowd smugness. Perhaps a younger trend-conscious listener will have more appreciation for Klosterman's virtues and less impatience with his faults. Y.R. � AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>When Broken Glass Floats: Growing Up Under the Khmer Rouge</h2><p>A survivor of the Cambodian genocide recounts a childhood in Cambodia, where rudimentary labor camps filled with death and illness were the norm and modern technology, such as cars and electricity, no longer existed. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>"Chea, how come good doesn't win over evil?" young Chanrithy Him asks her sister, after the brutal Khmer Rouge have seized power in Cambodia, but before hunger makes them too weak for philosophy. Chea answers only with a proverb: When good and evil are thrown together into the river of life, first the <i>klok</i> or squash (representing good) will sink, and the <i>armbaeg</i> or broken glass (representing evil) will float. But the broken glass, Chea assures her, never floats for long: "When good appears to lose, it is an opportunity for one to be patient, and become like God."<p> Before this proverb could come true, Chanrithy had to watch her mother, father, and five of her brothers and sisters die, murdered by the Khmer Rouge or fatally weakened by malnutrition, disease, and overwork. Now living in Oregon, where she studies posttraumatic stress disorder among Cambodian survivors, Chanrithy has written a first-person account of the killing fields that's remarkable for both its unflinching honesty and its refusal to despair. In wrenchingly immediate prose, she describes atrocities the rest of the world might prefer to ignore: her sick yet still breathing mother, thrown along with corpses into a well; a pregnant woman beaten to death with a spade, the baby struggling inside her; a sister impossibly swollen with edema, her starving body leaking fluid from the webbing between her toes. </p><p> The mind retreats from horrors like these--and yet what emerges most strongly from this memoir is the triumph of life. Chanrithy is determined to honor her pledge to the dying Chea, to study medicine so she can help others live. <i>When Broken Glass Floats</i> accomplishes the same goal in a different way. "As a survivor, I want to be worthy of the suffering that I endured," Chanrithy writes; by giving such eloquent voice to her dead, she has proven herself more than worthy of her suffering--and theirs. <i>--Chloe Byrne</i></p>Chanrithy Him, born in 1965, lives in Eugene, Oregon, where she works for the Khmer Adolescent Project, studying post-traumatic stress disorder among Cambodians.</p><h2>Party Animals: A Hollywood Tale of Sex, Drugs, and Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Starring the Fabulous Allan Carr</h2><p>Allan Carr was Hollywood&#x2019;s premier party-thrower during the town&#x2019;s most hedonistic era&#x2014;the cocaine-addled, sexually indulgent 1970s.

Dick</i>, Kim Stanley Robinson says that "<i>In Milton Lumky Territory</i> . . . is probably the best of Dick's realist novels aside from <i>Confessions of a Crap Artist</i>," and calls it a "bitter indictment of the effects of capitalism." Dick, on the other hand, in his forward, says "This is actually a very funny book, and a good one, too."</p><p>Milton Lumky territory is both an area of the western USA and a psychic terrain: the world and world-view of the traveling salesman. The story takes place in Boise, Idaho, with some extraordinary long-distance driving sequences in which our hero (young Bruce Stevens) drives from Boise to San Francisco, to Reno, to Pocatello, to Seattle, and back to Boise in search of a good deal on some wholesale typewriters. He falls under the spell of an attractive older woman, and of Milton Lumky, a middle-aged paper salesman whose territory is the Northwest. And then Bruce and the others slowly sink into the whirlpool of Bruce's immature personal obsessions and misperceptions.</p><p>A compassionate and ironic portrayal of three characters enmeshed in a sticky web of everyday events, who have a basic failure to communicate, <i>In Milton Lumky Territory</i> stands out among Dick's early works.</p></p><p><p><b>Philip K. Dick</b> has had many movies based on his stories, including the classic, <i>Blade Runner. </i></p>Chapter 1<br>At sunset, acrid-smelling air from the lake puffed along the empty streets of Montario, Idaho. With the air appeared clouds of sharp-winged yellow flies; they smashed against the windshields of cars in motion. The drivers strove to clear them away with their wipers. As the street lights lit up Hill Street, stores began to close until only the drugstores&#x2014;one at each end of town&#x2014;remained open. The Luxor movie theater did not open until six-thirty. The several cafes did not count as parts of the town; open or shut, they belonged to the highway, US 95, which made use of Hill Street.<br>Hooting and clacking and sliding along the northernmost of fourteen parallel tracks, the Union Pacific sleeper appeared, passing from Portland to Boise. It did not stop, but at the Hill Street crossing it slowed until the mail car appeared to be a dingy-green metal building among the brick warehouses along the track, scarcely in motion, with its doors open and two trainmen in striped suits hanging out with their hands dangling down. A middle-aged woman, wrapped up in quilted wool to keep warm, stepped forward at the sidewalk and deftly handed several letters up to one of the trainmen.<br>The wig-wag signal bonged and the red light flashed for a considerable period after the last car of the train had gone off out of sight.<br>At the lunch counter in his drugstore, Mr. Hagopian ate a small fried hamburger steak and canned string beans while he read a copy of Confidential taken from the rack by the front door. Now, at six, no customers bothered him. He sat so that he could see the street outside. If anyone came along he intended to stop eating and wipe his mouth and hands with a paper napkin.<br>Far off, running and whirling about to run backwards with his head up, came a boy wearing a Davy Crockett cap with tail. The boy circled his way across the street, and Mr. Hagopian realized that he was coming into the drugstore.<br>The boy, hands in his pockets, his motions stiff and jerky, stepped into the store and to the candy bars all intermingled under the sign, 3 for 25�. Mr. Hagopian continued eating and reading. The boy at last picked out a box of Milk Duds, a package of M &amp; M chocolates, and a Hershey bar.<br>&#x201c;Fred,&#x201d; Mr. Hagopian called.<br>His son Fred pushed the curtains aside, from the back room, and came out to wait on the boy.<br>At seven o&#x2019;clock Mr. Hagopian said to his son Fred, &#x201c;You might as well go on home. There won&#x2019;t be enough more tonight to make it worth both our time.&#x201d; He felt irritable, thinking about it. &#x201c;Nobody of consequence is going to show up and buy anything the rest of tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stick around awhile longer,&#x201d; Fred said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have anything to do anyhow.&#x201d;<br>The telephone rang. It was Mrs. de Rouge, on Pine Street, wanting a prescription filled and delivered. Mr. Hagopian got out the book, and when he looked up the number he found that it was for Mrs. de Rouge&#x2019;s pain pills. So he told her that Fred would bring them by eight o&#x2019;clock.<br>While he was making up the pills&#x2014;capsules of codeine&#x2014;the door of the drugstore opened and a young man, well-dressed in a single-breasted suit and tie, stepped in. He had a sandy, bony nose and short-cropped hair; by that, Mr. Hagopian recognized him, and also by his smile. He had good, strong white teeth.<br>&#x201c;Can I help you, sir?&#x201d; Fred said.<br>&#x201c;Just looking right now,&#x201d; the man said. Hands in his pockets he moved over to the magazine racks.<br>I wonder why he hasn&#x2019;t been in here for a while, Mr. Hagopian thought to himself. He used to come in here all the time. Since he was a kid. Has he been taking his business up to Wickley&#x2019;s? At that, the old man felt growing indignation. He finished up Mrs. de Rouge&#x2019;s pills, dropped them into a bottle, and walked to the counter.<br>The young man, Skip Stevens, had brought a copy of Life up to Fred, and was rummaging in his trouser pocket for change.<br>&#x201c;Anything else, sir?&#x201d; Fred said.<br>Mr. Hagopian started to speak to Skip Stevens, but at that moment Skip leaned toward Fred and said in a low voice, &#x201c;Yes, I wanted to pick up a package of Trojans.&#x201d; So Mr. Hagopian delicately turned away and busied himself until Fred had wrapped the package of contraceptives and rung up the sale on the register.<br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir,&#x201d; Fred said, in the business-like tone he always took when somebody bought contraceptives. As he left the counter he winked at his father.<br>His magazine under his arm, Skip started toward the door, very slowly, eyeing the magazines and shelves to show that he did not feel intimidated. Mr. Hagopian caught up with him and said, &#x201c;Long time no see.&#x201d; His indignation made his voice rattle. &#x201c;I hope you and your family have been well.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Everybody&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Skip said. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen them for a couple of months. I&#x2019;m living down in Reno. I have a job there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Mr. Hagopian said, not believing him. &#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br>Fred tilted his head, listening.<br>&#x201c;You remember Skip Stevens,&#x201d; Mr. Hagopian said to his son.<br>&#x201c;Oh yeah,&#x201d; Fred said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t recognize you.&#x201d; He nodded at Skip. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen you in months.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m located down in Reno now,&#x201d; Skip explained. &#x201c;This is the first time I&#x2019;ve been up here to Montario since April.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wondered why we hadn&#x2019;t seen you,&#x201d; Fred said.<br>Mr. Hagopian asked Skip, &#x201c;Your brother still off back east at school?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Skip said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s out of school now, and married.&#x201d;<br>This boy isn&#x2019;t living down in Reno, Mr. Hagopian thought. He&#x2019;s just ashamed to admit why he hasn&#x2019;t been in. Skip shifted about from one foot to the other, obviously ill-at-ease. He obviously wanted to leave.<br>&#x201c;What line of work are you in?&#x201d; Fred said.<br>Skip said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a buyer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What kind of buyer?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For C.B.B.,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Television?&#x201d; Mr. Hagopian said.<br>&#x201c;For Consumers&#x2019; Buying Bureau,&#x201d; Skip said.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br>Skip said, &#x201c;Something like a department store. It&#x2019;s a new place down on Highway 40, between Reno and Sparks.&#x201d;<br>With a strange look on his face, Fred said, &#x201c;I know what that is. Some guy was up here telling me about it.&#x201d; To his father, he said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of those discount houses.&#x201d;<br>At first, the old man did not understand. And then he remembered what he had heard about discount houses. &#x201c;Do you want to drive the retailers out of business?&#x201d; he said loudly to Skip.<br>Skip, turning red, said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no different from a supermarket. It buys in volume and passes the savings on to the consumer. That&#x2019;s how Henry Ford operated, producing in volume.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the American way,&#x201d; Mr. Hagopian said.<br>&#x201c;Sure it is,&#x201d; Skip said. &#x201c;It means a higher standard of living because it eliminates overhead and the middleman&#x2019;s costs.&#x201d;<br>Mr. Hagopian returned to the counter.

In 1917, a fifteen-year-old Bankhead boldly left her established Alabama political family and fled to New York City to sate her relentless need for attention and become a star. Five years later, she crossed the Atlantic, immediately taking her place as a fixture in British society and the most popular actress in London's West End. By the time she returned to America in the 1930s, she was infamous for throwing marathon parties, bedding her favorite costars, and neglecting to keep her escapades a secret from the press. At times, her notoriety distracted her audience from her formidable talent and achievements on stage and dampened the critical re-sponse to her work. As Bankhead herself put it, "they like me to 'Tallulah,' you know -- dance and sing and romp and fluff my hair and play reckless parts." Still, her reputation as a wild, witty, over-the-top leading lady persisted until the end of her life at the age of sixty-six.</p><p>From her friendships with such entertainment luminaries as Tennessee Williams, Estelle Winwood, Billie Holiday, No�l Coward, and Marlene Dietrich, to the intimate details of her family relationships and her string of doomed romances, Joel Lobenthal has captured the private essence of the most public star during theater's golden age. Larger-than-life as she was, friends saw through Bankhead's veneer of humor and high times to the heart of a woman who often felt second-best in her father's eyes, who longed for the children she was unableto bear, and who forced herself into the spotlight to hide her deep-seated insecurities.</p><p>Drawn from scores of exclusive interviews, as well as previously untapped information from Scotland Yard and the FBI, this is the essential biography of Tallulah Bankhead. Having spent twenty-five years researching Bankhead's life, Joel Lobenthal tells her unadulterated story, as told to him by her closest friends, enemies, lovers, and employees. Several have broken decadelong silences; many have given Lobenthal their final interviews. The result is the story of a woman more complex, more shocking, and yet more nuanced than her notorious legend suggests.</p></p><p><p>Joel Lobenthal is assistant editor of <em>Ballet Review</em>, and has also written for <em>Dance Magazine</em>, <em>Playbill</em>, <em>Quest</em>, and the <em>New York Times</em>. He is the author of <em>Radical Rags: Fashions of the Sixties</em>.</p>Critic Lobenthal (the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Playbill</i>, etc.) began researching Tallulah Bankhead (1902&#x2013;1968) as an undergraduate. Twenty-five years later, his exhaustively researched biography is the definitive, gloves-off evocation of the life of the brazen stage and screen actress so roundly ahead of her time. Bankhead was born in Huntsville, Ala. Her mother died three weeks after her birth from peritonitis; her father's family&#x2014;Dixiecrat politicians and lawyers&#x2014;provided an endlessly flamboyant if penurious background for her early life. Barely 16, Bankhead fled from Alabama's claustrophobic, restrictive society to New York. Before age 20, she was a resounding success on the London stage and already notorious for what would become her life-long profligate sex- and alcohol-related escapades. The 1930s brought her back to New York, the stage and a burgeoning interest in leftist politics, which landed her on J. Edgar Hoover's list of persons to watch. Unlike previous Bankhead biographers, Lobenthal doesn't pass judgment on the volatile actress or act as apologist; rather, he contextualizes her often outrageous behavior (like arriving onstage drunk) and explains her choices as an actress. And in contrast to Bankhead's autobiography, there is no dissembling; facts are stated, ramifications elucidated. Lobenthal's clean, reportorial prose flows more smoothly once Bankhead leaves the South and her multifaceted persona begins to glitter in earnest; the book's sole flaw is an obsessive attention to detail.

In fact, she was the most beautiful thing he&#x2019;d ever seen. But he hadn&#x2019;t expected her to sucker him into falling into the stream with most of his clothes on&#x2014;and make him lose his shirt&#x2014;and then laugh her silly head off about it just as if she were one of his idiot brothers.</p><p>Of course, maybe that was just what unicorns were like. How would he know? Nobody in human lands had seen one since... well, since the time of the Magic Unicorn Shalkan and Kellen the Poor Orphan Boy.</p><p>Thinking about Kellen, a hero out of the Nine Cities&#x2019; most ancient legends, made Harrier shiver just a little, and not with cold (although he was soaking wet, and the walk back to the wagon from the woods wasn&#x2019;t that pleasant in wet clothes), but because only a fortnight ago, he&#x2019;d been talking to the person who&#x2019;d taught that very hero to hold a sword. Who&#x2019;d helped the Wild Magic turn Kellen into a Knight-Mage, a great warrior who could defeat the Endarkened.</p><p>With that thought, the red leather satchel he had slung over his shoulder, small as it was, suddenly seemed incredibly heavy. Because it contained the Three Books of the Wild Magic, brought to him (not to Tiercel, to him) by the unicorn Kareta, and if Harrier could believe her (did unicorns tell lies?) he hadn&#x2019;t been granted the opportunity to become just an ordinary Wildmage&#x2014;as if there could be such a thing&#x2014; but a Knight-Mage.</p><p>Just like the hero Kellen had been.</p><p>Nobody knew how Kellen&#x2019;s story ended, though everyone knew how it began, and everyone knew the ending of his sister&#x2019;s, the Blessed Saint Idalia&#x2019;s. She married the King of the Elves (so the tales went), was granted immortality by the Light, and lived forever in the Elven Lands. But over the last several moonturns, Harrier had learned a lot about how the stories he&#x2019;d always taken for granted as being, well, wondertales (which meant they were sort-of true and sort-of not) were completely wrong about all the important things. Jermayan wasn&#x2019;t King of the Elves, just to begin with. And Elves certainly didn&#x2019;t live forever.</p><p>And having fought Goblins, and seen magical things that he had no name for, met Elves and dragons and all sorts of Otherfolk that had left the lands of Men in the time of the Great Flowering, Harrier&#x2019;d thought he&#x2019;d gotten used to things being strange by now. He and Tiercel had left Armethalieh almost four moonturns ago, at the beginning of summer, looking for a Wildmage who could put an end to Tiercel&#x2019;s little problem, as Harrier had thought of it then. Tiercel said he was having visions. Harrier thought Tiercel was having bad dreams.</p><p>But they really were visions, and that was only the start of problems that just got worse and worse. At least they had Ancaladar with them now, because the Elves had cast an incredibly powerful spell (that they hadn&#x2019;t been sure at the time was even going to work) to transfer Ancaladar&#x2019;s Bond from Jermayan to Tiercel, because otherwise Tiercel, whether he was a High Mage or not, wouldn&#x2019;t have the power he needed to cast his spells. So now Tiercel had the power, and all he had to do was learn all those spells, so when he&#x2019;d gotten up this morning, Harrier had thought they only had two problems to deal with.</p><p>One was the fact that Tiercel kept saying that it took about twenty or thirty years to train a High Mage (and he also kept saying that they didn&#x2019;t have that long before the Darkness came back), and the other was that they really had no idea of where they were going to find it and fight it, because nobody recognized the landscape from Tiercel&#x2019;s visions.</p><p>Now they had a third one.</p><p>Harrier really didn&#x2019;t like magic. It was weird. It made him uncomfortable. It wasn&#x2019;t that it was wrong or evil or bad, but... he was the youngest son of the Portmaster of Armethalieh, for the Light&#x2019;s sake! And he would have made a really rotten Portmaster, and he was glad now that he&#x2019;d left because that meant his older brother Brelt would be Portmaster instead, and Brelt would make a wonderful Portmaster, but what he was supposed to be doing out here was the same thing he&#x2019;d been doing for moonturns: keeping Tiercel out of trouble, and watching his back, and making sure that there was food and that Tiercel came in out of the rain and that nobody took advantage of him because Tiercel was much too easygoing for Harrier&#x2019;s peace of mind. And sure, Ancaladar could do some of that, but not all of it. And how was Harrier supposed to do any of it if he was being a Knight-Mage?</p><p>Even leaving aside that he didn&#x2019;t know the first thing about being a Knight-Mage, except that if you were one you were supposed to be an incredible warrior and a great leader of men. And he really wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>BY the time Harrier got back to the wagon, Kareta was already there. Her pale golden coat shimmered in the late-morning sunlight as if it were actual gold, and the long spiraling horn that grew from the center of her forehead glowed with the soft white iridescence of the inside of a seashell. Even as irritated as he was, Harrier couldn&#x2019;t help stopping to stare at her for just a moment: an actual unicorn&#x2014;most beautiful of the Otherfolk!</p><p>But she was tapping one small pink hoof in irritation as she waited for him, and kept glancing back over her shoulder toward him, interrupting her conversation with Tiercel and Ancaladar to do so. At least Ancaladar was having a conversation. Tiercel, Harrier was pleased to see, looked just as flummoxed as he had upon his first sight of Kareta.</p><p>Harrier wondered if the two of them had shown up of their own accord, or if Kareta had gone and gotten them&#x2014;he really didn&#x2019;t put anything past her at this point, because even though he&#x2019;d only talked to her for about five minutes, Harrier already knew that she was just as pushy and managing as any of his sisters-in-law. But maybe Ancaladar and Tiercel had just been drawn by&#x2014;for lack of a better term&#x2014;the scent of magic. Were unicorns magic in the same way that dragons were? He knew that they were Otherfolk, and creatures of the Light (as little as Kareta had been acting like one just now), but nobody really knew all that much about them; they hadn&#x2019;t been seen in human lands since the Great Flowering.</p><p>&#x201c;There you are!&#x201d; Kareta said, tossing her head. &#x201c;Well it took you long enough&#x2014;did you stop to take a bath after all? Come on! We&#x2019;ve got a lot to talk about!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My clothes are wet. I&#x2019;m going to change,&#x201c; Harrier said sulkily.</p><p>He wanted to toss the satchel with the Three Books down on the ground just to show Kareta what he thought of her bright idea that he should become a Knight-Mage, but he couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to do it. Whatever he thought of the idea of becoming one, a Knight-Mage was a Wildmage, and Wildmages were guardians of the Great Balance, and Harrier worshipped at the Shrine of the Eternal Light&#x2014;the Great Balance as it was venerated in the Nine Cities&#x2014;just like everyone else in Armethalieh. The Light might be known by different names in different places: as Leaf and Star to the Elves, as the Herdsman to the Centaurs, as the Huntsman and the Forest Wife back in the Hills, and even in some places as the Good Goddess, but it was all the same Light, the same way as the sun was the same sun, no matter where you went. Without another word, he sighed, and settled the satchel firmly on his shoulder as he walked past the other three and climbed the steps into the wagon.</p><p>He ducked his head as he stepped up and inside. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to like it. You just have to do it.&#x201d; That was one of his father&#x2019;s favorite sayings, and it had gotten Harrier through many an afternoon of tedious chores. He wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure that Antarans Gillain had ever meant it to apply to his youngest son becoming a Wildmage, though.</p><p>Well, maybe there was a way out. He was sure Ancaladar would know.</p><p>He closed the door of the wagon behind him, and bolted it too, just to make sure he had a little time alone to think. He kept his head ducked; Tiercel could stand upright in here, but Harrier was a good half-head taller than Tiercel was, and he&#x2019;d already collected more than his fair share of bruises from the ceiling and doorframe of the wagon.</p><p>THE true purpose of the wagon wasn&#x2019;t actually to provide him and Tiercel with a place to sleep, but to provide Tiercel with a portable workroom, for unlike the Wild Magic, the High Magick required a large number of ingredients, and research books, and tools. But at the moment it also held all their belongings, for though the boys had arrived at Karahelanderialigor, city of the Elven Mages, with little more than the clothes on their backs, they had left it fully-provisioned, thanks to the generosity of House Malkirinath.</p><p>He sat down on one of the chests to remove his boots, setting the satchel carefully aside. The boots were durable leather, made for hard use (and even for wading into a stream, if need be), but it would take them hours to dry. He set them in a corner. He&#x2019;d oil them later, to keep them from stiffening as they dried. Then he dragged off his overtunic (his shirt was floating downstream, but if he was lucky, it had caught on a branch, and he&#x2019;d be able to retrieve it later; he had others, but that was his favorite) and got to his feet to rummage through the chest for a change of clothes. At least he&#x2019;d packed up the camp this morning before he&#x2019;d gone off for his ill-advised morning swim, so he was able to lay hands on a drying cloth and his camp boots without tearing the whole org...</p></p><h2>Kamikaze Kaito Jeanne, Vol. 2</h2><p>Kusakabe Maron spends her days as an ordinary teenaged girl, but at night she hunts down demon possessed paintings to exorcise evil spirits.</p><p></p><h2>Rush to Judgment: A Critique of the Warren Commission&#39;s Inquiry into the Murders of President John F.

He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, and their children in Bangor, Maine.Thinner CHAPTER 1<p></p> 246<p></p> <br>Thinner,&#x201d; the old Gypsy man with the rotting nose whispers to William Halleck as Halleck and his wife, Heidi, come out of the courthouse. Just that one word, sent on the wafting, cloying sweetness of his breath. &#x201c;Thinner.&#x201d; And before Halleck can jerk away, the old Gypsy reaches out and caresses his cheek with one twisted finger. His lips spread open like a wound, showing a few tombstone stumps poking out of his gums. They are black and green. His tongue squirms between them and then slides out to slick his grinning, bitter lips.<br> <br>Thinner.<br> <br>This memory came back to Billy Halleck, fittingly enough, as he stood on the scales at seven in the morning with a towel wrapped around his middle. The good smells of bacon and eggs came up from downstairs. He had to crane forward slightly to read the numbers on the scale. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. actually, he had to crane forward more than slightly. Actually he had to crane forward quite a lot. He was a big man. Too big, as Dr. Houston delighted in telling him. In case no one ever told you, let me pass you the information, Houston had told him after his last checkup. A man of your age, income, and habits enters heart-attack country at roughly age thirty-eight, Billy. You ought to take off some weight.<br> <br>But this morning there was good news. He was down three pounds, from 249 to 246.<br> <br>Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the scale had actually read 251 the last time he&#x2019;d had the courage to stand on it and take a good look, but he&#x2019;d had his pants on, and there had been some change in his pockets, not to mention his keyring and his Swiss army knife. And the upstairs bathroom scale weighed heavy. He was morally sure of it.<br> <br>As a kid growing up in New York he&#x2019;d heard Gypsies had the gift of prophecy. Maybe this was the proof. He tried to laugh and could only raise a small and not very successful smile; it was still too early to laugh about Gypsies. Time would pass and things would come into perspective; he was old enough to know that. But for now he still felt sick to his too-large stomach at the thought of Gypsies, and hoped heartily he would never see another in his life. From now on he would pass on the palm-reading at parties and stick to the Ouija board. If that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Billy?&#x201d; From downstairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Coming!&#x201d;<br> <br>He dressed, noting with an almost subliminal distress that in spite of the three-pound drop the waist of his pants was getting tight again. His waist size was forty-two now. He had quit smoking at exactly 12:01 on New Year&#x2019;s Day, but he had paid. Oh, boy, had he paid. He went downstairs with his collar open and his tie lying around his neck. Linda, his fourteen-year-old daughter, was just going out the door in a flirt of skirt and a flip of her ponytail, tied this morning with a sexy velvet ribbon. Her books were under one arm. Two gaudy cheerleader&#x2019;s pom-poms, purple and white, rustled busily in her other hand.<br> <br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Bye, Dad!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have a good day, Lin.&#x201d;<br> <br>He sat down at the table, grabbed The Wall Street Journal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lover,&#x201d; Heidi said.<br> <br>&#x201c;My dear,&#x201d; he said grandly, and turned the Journal facedown beside the lazy Susan.<br> <br>She put breakfast in front of him: a steaming mound of scrambled eggs, an English muffin with raisins, five strips of crisp country-style bacon. Good eats. She slipped into the seat opposite him in the breakfast nook and lit a Vantage 100. January and February had been tense&#x2014;too many &#x201c;discussions&#x201d; that were only disguised arguments, too many nights they had finished sleeping back to back. But they had reached a modus vivendi: she had stopped dunning him about his weight and he had stopped yapping at her about her pack-and-a-half-a-day butt habit. It had made for a decent-enough spring. And beyond their own private balance, other good things had happened. Halleck had been promoted, for one. Greely, Penschley, and Kinder was now Greely, Penschley, Kinder, and Halleck. Heidi&#x2019;s mother had finally made good on her long-standing threat to move back to Virginia. Linda had at last made J.V. cheerleaders and to Billy this was a great blessing; there had been times when he had been sure Lin&#x2019;s histrionics would drive him into a nervous breakdown. Everything had been going just great.<br> <br>Then the Gypsies had come to town.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thinner,&#x201d; the old Gypsy man had said, and what the hell was it with his nose? Syphilis? Cancer? Or something even more terrible, like leprosy? And by the way, why can&#x2019;t you just quit it? Why can&#x2019;t you just let it alone?<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t get it off your mind, can you?&#x201d; Heidi said suddenly&#x2014;so suddenly that Halleck started in his seat. &#x201c;Billy, it was not your fault. The judge said so.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t thinking about that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then what were you thinking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Journal,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It says housing starts are down again this quarter.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not his fault, right; the judge had said so. Judge Rossington. Cary, to his friends.<br> <br>Friends like me, Halleck thought. Played many a round of golf with old Cary Rossington, Heidi, as you well know. At our New Year&#x2019;s Eve party two years ago, the year I thought about giving up smoking and didn&#x2019;t do it, who grabbed your oh-so-grabbable tit during the traditional happy-new-year kiss? Guess who? Why, my stars! It was good old Cary Rossington, as I live and breathe!<br> <br>Yes. Good old Cary Rossington, before whom Billy had argued more than a dozen municipal cases. Good old Cary Rossington with whom Billy sometimes played poker down at the club. Good old Cary Rossington who hadn&#x2019;t disqualified himself when his good old golfing-and-poker buddy Billy Halleck (Cary would sometimes clap him on the back and yell, &#x201c;How they hangin&#x2019;, Big Bill?&#x201d;) came before him in court, not to argue some point of municipal law, but on a charge of vehicular manslaughter.<br> <br>And when Cary Rossington did not disqualify himself, who said boo, children? Who in this whole fair town of Fairview was the boo-sayer? Why, nobody, that&#x2019;s who! Nobody said boo! After all, what were they? Nothing but a bunch of filthy Gypsies. The sooner they were out of Fairview and headed up the road in their old station wagons with the NRA stickers on the back bumpers, the sooner we saw the rear ends of their home-carpentered trailers and camper caps, the better. The sooner the&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x2014;thinner.<br> <br>Heidi snuffed her cigarette and said, &#x201c;Shit on your housing starts. I know you better.&#x201d;<br> <br>Billy supposed so. And he supposed she had been thinking about it, too. Her face was too pale. She looked her age&#x2014;thirty-five&#x2014;and that was rare. They had married very, very young, and he still remembered the traveling salesman who had come to the door selling vacuum cleaners one day after they had been married three years. He had looked at the twenty-two-year-old Heidi Halleck and had asked politely, &#x201c;Is your mother home, hon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not hurting my appetite any,&#x201d; he said, and that was certainly true. Angst or no angst, he had lain waste to the scrambled eggs, and of the bacon there was now no sign. He drank half his orange juice and gave her a big old Billy Halleck grin. She tried to smile back and it didn&#x2019;t quite happen. He imagined her wearing a sign: MY SMILER IS TEMPORARILY OUT OF ORDER.<br> <br>He reached across the table and took her hand. &#x201c;Heidi, it&#x2019;s all right. And even if it&#x2019;s not, it&#x2019;s all over.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know it is. I know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is Linda&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Not anymore. She says&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she says her girlfriends are being very supportive.&#x201d;<br> <br>For about a week after it had happened, their daughter had had a bad time of it. She had come home from school either in tears or close to them. She had stopped eating. Her complexion had flared up. Halleck, determined not to overreact, had gone in to see her homeroom teacher, the assistant principal, and Linda&#x2019;s beloved Miss Nearing, who taught phys ed and cheerleading. He ascertained (ah, there was a good lawyerly word) that it was teasing, mostly&#x2014;as rough and unfunny as most junior-high-school teasing is apt to be, and tasteless to be sure, considering the circumstances, but what could you expect of an age group that thought dead-baby jokes were the height of wit?<br> <br>He had gotten Linda to take a walk with him up the street. Lantern Drive was lined with tasteful set-back-from-the-road homes, homes which began at roughly $75,000 and worked up into the $200,000 indoor-pool-and-sauna range by the time you got to the country-club end of the street.<br> <br>Linda had been wearing her old madras shorts, which were now torn along one seam&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and, Halleck observed, her legs had now grown so long and coltish that the leg bands of her yellow cotton panties showed. He felt a pang of mingled regret and terror. She was growing up. He supposed she knew the old madras shorts were too small, worn out in the bargain, but he guessed she had put them on because they made a link with a more comforting childhood, a childhood where daddies did not have to go to court and stand trial (no matter how cut-and-dried that trial might be, with your old golf buddy and that drunken grabber of your wife&#x2019;s tit, Cary Rossington, driving the gavel), a childhood where kids did not rush up to you on the soccer field during period four while you were eating your lunch to ask you how many points your dad had gotten for bagging the old lady.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>You understand it was an accident, don&#x2019;t you, Linda?<br> <br>She nods, not looking at him. Yes, Daddy.<br> <br>She came out between two cars without looking either way. There was no time for me to stop. Absolutely no time.<br> <br>Daddy, I don&#x2019;t want to hear about it.<br> <br>I know you don&#x2019;t. And I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it. But you are hearing about it. At school.<br> <br>She looks at him feafully. Daddy! You didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;<br> <br>Go to your school? Yeah. I did. But not until three-thirty yesterday afternoon. There were no kids there at all, at least that I could see. No one&#x2019;s going to know.<br> <br>She relaxes. A little.<br> <br>I heard you&#x2019;ve been getting some pretty rough handling from the other kids. I&#x2019;m sorry about that.<br> <br>It hasn&#x2019;t been so bad, she says, taking his hand. Her face&#x2014;the fresh scatter of angry-looking pimples on her forehead&#x2014;tells a different story. The pimples say the handling has been rough indeed. Having a parent arrested is not a situation even Judy Blume covers (although someday she probably will).<br> <br>I also hear you&#x2019;ve been handling it pretty well, Billy Halleck says. Not making a big thing out of it. Because if they ever see they&#x2019;re getting under your skin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Yeah, I know, she says glumly.<br> <br>Miss Nearing said she was especially proud of you, he says. It&#x2019;s a small lie. Miss Nearing hadn&#x2019;t said precisely that, but she had certainly spoken well of Linda, and that meant almost as much to Halleck as it did to his daughter. And it does the job. Her eyes brighten and she looks at Halleck for the first time.<br> <br>She did?<br> <br>She did, Halleck confirms. The lie comes easily and convincingly. Why not? He has told a lot of lies just lately.<br> <br>She squeezes his hand and smiles at him gratefully.<br> <br>They&#x2019;ll let it go pretty soon, Lin. They&#x2019;ll find some other bone to chew. Some girl will get pregnant or a teacher will have a nervous breakdown or some boy will get busted for selling pot or cocaine. And you&#x2019;ll be off the hook. Get it?<br> <br>She throws her arms around him suddenly and hugs him tight. He decides she isn&#x2019;t growing up so fast after all, and that not all lies are bad. I love you, Daddy, she says.<br> <br>I love you too, Lin.<br> <br>He hugs her back and suddenly someone turns on a big stereo amplifier in the front of his brain and he hears the double-thud again: the first as the Ninety-Eight&#x2019;s front bumper strikes the old Gypsy woman with the bright red cloth kerchief over her scraggly hair, the second as the big front wheels pass over her body.<br> <br>Heidi screams.<br> <br>And her hand leaves Halleck&#x2019;s lap.<br> <br>Halleck hugs his daughter tighter, feeling goose flesh break all over his body.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>&#x201c;More eggs?&#x201d; Heidi asked, breaking into his reverie.<br> <br>&#x201c;No. No, thanks.&#x201d; He looked at his clean plate with some guilt: no matter how bad things got, they had never gotten bad enough to cause him to lose either sleep or his appetite.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay?&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay, you&#x2019;re okay, Linda&#x2019;s okay. As they say on the soap operas, the nightmare is over&#x2014;can we please get back to our lives?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lovely idea.&#x201d; This time she returned his smile with a real one of her own&#x2014;she was suddenly under thirty again, and radiant. &#x201c;Want the rest of the bacon? There&#x2019;s two slices left.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, thinking of the way his pants nipped at his soft waist (what waist, ha-ha? a small and unfunny Don Rickles spoke up in his mind&#x2014;the last time you had a waist was around 1978, you hockey puck), the way he had to suck in his gut to hook the catch. Then he thought of the scale and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have one of them. I&#x2019;ve lost three pounds.&#x201d;<br> <br>She had gone to the stove in spite of his original no&#x2014;sometimes she knows me so well it gets to be depressing, he thought. Now she glanced back. &#x201c;You are still thinking about it, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; he said, exasperated. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t a man lose three pounds in peace? You keep saying you&#x2019;d like me a little&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>thinner<br> <br>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a little less beefy.&#x201d; Now she had gotten him thinking about the Gypsy again. Dammit! The Gypsy&#x2019;s eaten nose and the scaly feel of that one finger sliding along his cheek in the moment before he had reacted and jerked away&#x2014;the way you would jerk away from a spider or from a clittering bundle of beetles fuming in a knot under a rotted log.<br> <br>She brought him the bacon and kissed his temple. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. You go right ahead and lose some weight. But if you don&#x2019;t, remember what Mr. Rogers says&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;I like you just the way you are,&#x201d; they finished in unison.<br> <br>He prodded at the overturned Journal by the lazy Susan, but that was just too depressing. He got up, went outside, and found the New York Times in the flowerbed. The kid always threw it in the flowerbed, never had his numbers right at the end of the week, could never remember Bill&#x2019;s last name. Billy had wondered on more than one occasion if it was possible for a twelve-year-old kid to become a victim of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease.<br> <br>He took the paper back inside, opened it to the sports, and ate the bacon. He was deep in the box scores when Heidi brought him another half of English muffin, golden with melting butter.<br> <br>Halleck ate it almost without being aware he was doing so.</p><h2>Perla Meyers&#39; from Market-To-Kitchen Cookbook</h2><p>More than three hundred out-of-theordinary recipes yielding meals rich in fresh, natural flavors highlight this comprehensive cookbook designed to wisely and economically defeat the packaged, artificial foods of the supermarket</p><p></p><h2>What Were Castles for (Starting Point History Series)</h2><p>-- Gives answers to the first questions children ask about history, provoking comparison with life as they know it today</p><p></p><h2>Space Travel: A History : An Update of History of Rocketry &amp; Space Travel</h2><p>Will be dispatched from UK.

With their bulging arms and deltoids and pecs, not to mention their rippling abdominal muscles, they appear on magazine covers, in underwear ads, in action movies. And American men have noticed them; after a generation of being bombarded by images of idealized male physiques, men are growing increasingly insecure about their own appearance.<p> The authors have studied everything from bodybuilders to <i>Playgirl</i> centerfolds and concluded that the images presented to men and women have gotten steadily more muscular. As a result of this bombardment of pumped-up male imagery, American men have been developing eating disorders, working out to the point of obsession, and taking steroids. None of this is for health or sports performance but rather to develop a physique that matches those seen on the cover of <i>Muscle &amp; Fitness</i> or in the next squat rack over.</p><p> Another consequence is a condition the authors call "muscle dysmorphia," also known as "reverse anorexia" or just "bigorexia." In this, men who are large and muscular look in the mirror and see someone who is puny and frail. So they pump iron and eat and take steroids and swell to ever-larger proportions, while being too ashamed of their bodies to take off their sweatshirts at the beach.</p><p> The authors postulate that all this has to do with the rising power of women in society. To back this up, they produce timelines showing how women's-rights milestones correlate with increasing images of men as sex objects.</p><p> What's the solution? The authors list some Web sites to help men suffering from the Adonis Complex to find therapists familiar with the problem. Sometimes antidepressants can work. But for most people, the answer is to understand that the images of perfect male physiques they see are unattainable, and that no one really expects them to look like that anyway. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>Praise for The Adonis Complex: <p>"Ten years after the Beauty Myth we finally understand the relationship between society's expectations of boys and men and how they think about their bodies. The Adonis Complex sounds the alarm about the newest and least understood threat to their physical, social, and emotional development. Everyone who cares about men, young and old, should read this indispensable book." --William Pollack, Ph.D., author of Real Boys: Rescuing our Sons from the Myths of Boyhood </p><p>"A great many men suffer in silence with body image obsession.

Wearing a T-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops, he was heading home in his unmarked police car, driving west on Route 329 in rural East Allen Township. An eight-year veteran with the state police, Rowlands had just taken the vehicle to a car wash and was driving toward Northampton, a small working-class borough on the western edge of Northampton County, Pennsylvania. <br>Although a major roadway in the township, Route 329, also known as Nor-Bath Boulevard, is a fairly quiet country road, with trees and foliage on Rowlands&#x2019;s right and grassy clearings and a few small businesses on his left. He was approaching a traffic light at the intersection of Route 329 and Savage Road, near the Miller Supply Ace Hardware store, when he saw the Pontiac Grand Prix GT speeding toward him from the opposite direction. <br>Observing the erratic driving, Rowlands immediately suspected a drunken driver. Just as it approached the intersection, the car cut across the opposite lane of travel, not quite close enough to strike Rowlands. <br>He pulled his own car over to the side of Route 329 as the Pontiac careened off the roadway, where it became airborne for a few moments before crashing into a patch of trees in a grassy shoulder area just past the intersection. <br>Rowlands switched on the emergency lights of his car and radioed in to the state police barracks in the nearby city of Bethlehem, which covers this area of Northampton County. He notified the station about the crash and asked them to send the trooper assigned to that zone before exiting his car to head back to the crashed Pontiac. A few people were already milling around as Rowlands approached. Despite his casual attire, he identified himself as a police officer and ordered them to stand back as he approached the driver&#x2019;s-side window. <br>The front driver&#x2019;s side of the car had struck the trees, causing extensive damage and forcing both the driver and passenger air bags to deploy. As Rowlands glanced inside, he found a man slumped over with his lower torso on the driver&#x2019;s side but his upper body lying across the passenger seat, his head nearly resting on the front passenger door. There were no other passengers in the car. The man&#x2014;a Caucasian who appeared to be in his mid- to late thirties&#x2014;seemed to be unconscious, and Rowlands could hear his slow, shallow breaths. <br>Rowlands called out to the man, but got no response. As he looked closer, he saw that the man was covered in blood, particularly around his lower torso and crotch area. Both the driver&#x2019;s and the front passenger seats were drenched in the man&#x2019;s blood. <br>&#x201c;Keep an eye on him,&#x201d; Rowlands said as he turned toward a woman standing near the scene. &#x201c;Let me know if the breathing stops or anything like that.&#x201d; <br>Rowlands returned to his car and called the dispatch center to update them on the seriousness of the incident. <br>&#x201c;Step up the responding unit, it looks like a pretty serious crash,&#x201d; Rowlands said before rushing back to the wrecked car, where the woman still stood watching the driver. After about two minutes, the injured man started to stir and appeared to regain consciousness. <br>&#x201c;My name is Corporal Mark Rowlands with the Pennsylvania State Police,&#x201d; Rowlands told the man. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve just been in a motor vehicle accident. Do not move.&#x201d; <br>Rowlands started asking the driver questions to test his memory and cognitive abilities, hoping to keep him focused and conscious. <br>&#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d; Rowlands asked. <br>&#x201c;Michael,&#x201d; the man said slowly, still obviously dazed and in a great amount of pain. He had blue eyes, short strawberry-blond hair, and a goatee. <br>&#x201c;Where are you coming from, Michael?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I just killed everyone.&#x201d; <br>Rowlands was taken aback by the response, but maintained his composure and professionalism. <br>&#x201c;What do you mean by that?&#x201d; Rowlands asked. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s obvious,&#x201d; Michael replied. &#x201c;I just killed everyone.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Officer Joseph York from the Northampton Police Department was the first to arrive at the scene of 1917 Lincoln Avenue. It was 4:50 p.m., just three minutes after a call had gone out over the radio about a disturbance involving a stabbing at that address. York was one of twelve full-time officers and six part-time officers in the department covering a borough of just over two and a half square miles, where reported stabbings were hardly a common occurrence. <br>York pulled onto Lincoln Avenue with his white patrol car, the siren blaring, the word NORTHAMPTON printed in red letters along the side of the vehicle. Just a block away from a series of blue-collar row homes, the 1900 block of Lincoln consisted of nicer middle-class town houses. Number 1917 was one half of a relatively large double atop a small grassy hill with a brick front porch and tan siding on the upper half of the house beneath a peaked roof. <br>The windows had white trimming, and boxes containing an assortment of colorful flowers sat along the edges of the porch. Rows of neatly trimmed bushes ran alongside the front of the home, which was accessible on either side by concrete walkways leading up to a set of steps on both sides of the porch. Several people were staggering around the front yard as York stepped out of his police cruiser. <br>Most of them were screaming. <br>Among the crowd was Janet Zernhelt, a fifty-four-year-old woman who said she lived in 1915 Lincoln Avenue, the other half of the twin home. She was nearly hysterical with panic and difficult to understand, but she indicated to York that her husband was inside 1917 and had been hurt badly. <br>&#x201c;Help him! Help them!&#x201d; she kept shouting. &#x201c;Help them!&#x201d; <br>York ordered the people to stay put and wait for him to assess the scene. They would have to be interviewed later, but for now York had to find out exactly what he was dealing with. He rushed up the steps on the 1917 side of the porch, where a small brick wall separated the two halves of the twin home. A bicycle that looked small enough for a young teen lay in a heap in the corner next to a black metal table and set of patio chairs. <br>York&#x2019;s eyes were immediately drawn to the blood. <br>A trail of red droplets stained the porch floor in a tiny path leading from the front door toward the steps. It was a light drizzled pattern&#x2014;almost like someone had flicked a line of red paint with a brush onto the floor&#x2014;and it stopped before it reached the stairs, as if somebody had started to leave that way from the front door but doubled back inside. A screen door was closed but the front door was wide open and York, who had probable cause to enter the house due to the blood, opened the screen door and stepped inside. <br>The front door opened into a living room area with a television sitting on a brown wooden stand in the corner, and a red-and-black-plaid couch across from it behind a wooden coffee table. The carpet, like the porch, was stained by a trail of blood, and a pair of legs was just visible, sticking out between the couch and the coffee table, which had been knocked askew. <br>York rushed over and found the body of a man curled on his left side almost in a fetal position, his arms folded atop each other in front of him, the fingers from his right hand outstretched as if he were trying to shake someone&#x2019;s hand. His bloodied face, which bore a brown mustache and light stubbly beard, lay in a grape-colored puddle of blood on the carpet. <br>Wearing a white T-shirt and pair of black athletic shorts, the man had been stabbed repeatedly and was covered in blood, with deep stains especially around his face and down the back of his shirt below the neck. The tip of his left thumb was completely severed from the hand. Some plastic children&#x2019;s toys lay on the floor next to him. <br>Aside from the screaming of the people standing outside, York could hear very little within the home except what sounded like a television set in a room deeper inside. York stood and walked toward the next room, a dining area accessible from a large open doorway. <br>Painted on the wall above that doorway was an inscription in black letters that read: LEARN FROM YESTERDAY, LIVE FOR TODAY, HOPE FOR TOMORROW. <br>The dining room was empty except for a large oak hutch with a few framed photographs along the edges and a dining table with piles of papers and junk on top. There was nothing unusual except for a familiar trail of blood drops leading into the next room. York followed that trail into the kitchen, where he found a scene even grislier than that in the living room. <br>The blood-soaked body of a woman lay flat on her back in the middle of the floor, with a huge crimson puddle splayed out alongside her, staining the brown Formica tiles. Her arms and legs were spread out, as if she were about to hug someone. Like the man in the living room, she wore black shorts and a white T-shirt, although her body was so covered in blood that it was difficult to see what color the shirt was at all. <br>She looked as if she had been stabbed dozens of times, even more times than the dead man in the living room. A tattoo of a multicolored rose was just visible on her ankle amid all the blood, as was a tattoo of a stylized dragonfly on her right foot. <br>York tore his eyes away from the woman and quickly surveyed the rest of the kitchen. The cluttered table contained an array of regular household items: plastic cereal containers, piles of mail, a loaf of bread, a plastic tub of pretzels, a few prescription bottles of pills, and a red-and-black plastic children&#x2019;s lunch box. <br>The dead body lay in front of a black refrigerator, a white dishwasher, and a row of white cupboards. A few of the cupboards were stained with blood, particularly those just above the dead woman&#x2019;s head, where a large crimson smear was visible. A few drops of blood were still running down from it, dripping onto the floor. <br>York noticed what appeared to be a couple of bloody footprints around the corpse. Even at a glance, it was obvious that whoever had done this had worn boots. The noise from the television set was even louder now, and he could tell it was coming from a room through a doorway on the other side of the kitchen. The dead woman&#x2019;s left arm was stretched out directly toward that doorway, as if it were pointing, or perhaps reaching for the room. <br>York stepped from the tiled kitchen onto a pepper-colored Berber carpet. It was a tiny room, much of which was taken up by a hospital bed in the corner. In the middle of the room sat an elderly man in a wheelchair, his head leaning back, sitting just a few feet away from a small television atop a folding table. A baseball game was playing on the TV, and at first glance you might believe the man had simply fallen asleep while watching the game&#x2014;if not for the gruesome gash in his neck. <br>It was a ghastly sight, even after the two horribly maimed corpses elsewhere in the house. The man couldn&#x2019;t have been much younger than ninety. His head lay back against the headrest of his wheelchair, his eyes shut, his toothless mouth wide open, his neck cut open in a bloody slash about three or four inches wide. A purplish stream of blood ran like a waterfall from his neck all the way down his gray T-shirt into the seat of his chair, where blood dripped through onto the carpet underneath. A Lifeline alarm was still wrapped around his neck, drenched in blood. The middle finger on his left hand looked shredded, with a bloody chunk of skin peeled away from the knuckle up, as if he&#x2019;d tried to block the attacker with his hand before he died. <br>After a few more moments of investigation, York cleared the remaining rooms on the first floor and found nobody else, alive or dead. He reported what he had found into the radio, and let the dispatcher know they were dealing with multiple homicide victims. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Colin McEvoy and Lynn Olanoff <br></p><h2>The Letters of Virginia Wolf, 1912-1922</h2><p>A collection of Virginia Woolf&#39;s correspondence from age six to the eve of her marriage twenty-four years later. &#34;Engagingly fresh and spontaneous as young Virginia&#39;s letters are...the excitement in this collection arises from [her] growing awareness of herself as a writer&#34; (Chicago Sun-Times).

Tezuka evidences his profound grasp of the subject by contextualizing the Buddha&#x2019;s ideas; the emphasis is on movement, action, emotion, and conflict as the prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India, and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression. Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka&#x2019;s Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one&#x2019;s life sensibly. Philosophical segments are threaded into interpersonal situations with ground-breaking visual dynamism by an artist who makes sure never to lose his readers&#x2019; attention.<br><br>Tezuka himself was a humanist rather than a Buddhist, and his magnum opus is not an attempt at propaganda. Hermann Hesse&#x2019;s novel or Bertolucci&#x2019;s film is comparable in this regard; in fact, Tezuka&#x2019;s approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humor.</p><p>Osamu Tezuka (1928-89) is the godfather of Japanese manga comics. He originally intended to become a doctor and earned his degree before turning to what was then a medium for children. His many early masterpieces include the series known in the U.S. as <i>Astro Boy</i>. With his sweeping vision, deftly interwined plots, feel for the workings of power, and indefatigable commitment to human dignity, Tezuka elevated manga to an art form. The later Tezuka, when he authored Buddha, often had in mind the mature readership that manga gained in the sixties and that had only grown ever since. The Kurosawa of Japanese pop culture, Osamu Tezuka is a twentieth century classic."Infused with humor and history, the epic of Siddhartha is perhaps Osamu Tezuka's crowning acheivement and illustrates why, without irony, Tezuka is referred to as 'The King of Japanese Comics'." -<b><i> LA Weekly</i></b>"Buddha is one of Tezuka's true masterpieces. We're lucky to have this excellent new edition in English." - <b><i>Scott McCloud</i></b>, author of <i>Understanding Comics</i>"In handsome volumes designed by Chip Kidd, the Vertical books present Tezuka at his best." - <b><i>National Post<br></i></b><br>"<i>Buddha</i> is an engrossing tale. The armchair philosopher, the devout Buddhist, the casual manga fan - this book satisfies all with its tale of humanism through sequential art, and definitely earns its place on a bibliophile's bookshelf." -<b><i>Anime Insider</i></b>"This is one of the greatest acheivements of the comics medium, a masterpiece by one of the greats." -<b><i>Artbomb.net</i></b>"In Tezuka's world, the exquisite collapses into the goofy in a New York minute, the goofy into the melodramatic, the melodramatic into the brutal, and the brutal into the sincerely touching. The suprising result is a work wholly unique and downright fun." -<b><i>Time Out NY</i></b><i>"</i>Tezuka's Buddha is a striking and memorable confluence of ancient wisdom and contemporary popular art." -<b><i>Yoga Journal<br><br></i></b></p><h2>In Praise of the Stepmother</h2><p>An erotic tale of a sensual middle-aged stepmother, her attentive husband, and his pre-pubescent son explores the mysterious nature of happiness and the corrupting power in innocence</p><p>Peru's foremost writer, Mario Vargas Llosa is the author of ten novels, including <i>Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter</i>, <i>The War of the End of the World</i>, <i>Death in the Andes</i>, and <i>The Storyteller</i>.

The true story of a Cambodian heroine.</h2><p><p><b>A portion of the proceeds of this book will be donated to the Somaly Mam Foundation.</b></p><p><b>A riveting, raw, and beautiful memoir of tragedy and hope<br></b><br>Born in a village deep in the Cambodian forest, Somaly Mam was sold into sexual slavery by her grandfather when she was twelve years old. For the next decade she was shuttled through the brothels that make up the sprawling sex trade of Southeast Asia. Trapped in this dangerous and desperate world, she suffered the brutality and horrors of human trafficking&#x2014;rape, torture, deprivation&#x2014;until she managed to escape with the help of a French aid worker. Emboldened by her newfound freedom, education, and security, Somaly blossomed but remained haunted by the girls in the brothels she left behind.<br>Written in exquisite, spare, unflinching prose, <i>The Road of Lost Innocence</i> recounts the experiences of her early life and tells the story of her awakening as an activist and her harrowing and brave fight against the powerful and corrupt forces that steal the lives of these girls. She has orchestrated raids on brothels and rescued sex workers, some as young as five and six; she has built shelters, started schools, and founded an organization that has so far saved more than four thousand women and children in Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. Her memoir will leave you awestruck by her tenacity and courage and will renew your faith in the power of an individual to bring about change.</p><p>To learn more about how you can help fight human trafficking, visit the foundation&#x2019;s website: www.somaly.org.</p></p><p><b>Somaly Mam</b> is the cofounder of AFESIP (Acting for Women in Distressing Situations) in Europe and The Somaly Mam Foundation in the United States, whose goal is to save and socially reintegrate victims of sexual slavery in Southeast Asia. She was named <i>Glamour</i>'s Woman of theYear in 2006. She lives in Cambodia and France..1.<br>The Forest<br>My name is Somaly. At least that's the name I have now. Like everyone in Cambodia, I've had several. Names are the result of temporary choices. You change them the way you'd change lives. As a small child, I was called Ya, and sometimes just Non--"Little One." When I was taken away from the forest by the old man, I was called Aya, and once, at a border crossing, he told the guard my name was Viriya--I don't really know why. I got used to people calling me all sorts of names, mostly insults. Then, years later, a kind man who said he was my uncle gave me the name Somaly: "The Necklace of Flowers Lost in the Virgin Forest." I liked it; it seemed to fit the idea of who I felt I really was. When I finally had the choice, I decided to keep that name as my own.<br>I will never know what my parents called me. But then I have nothing from them, no memories at all. My adoptive father once gave me this typically Khmer advice: "You shouldn't try to discover the past. You shouldn't hurt yourself." I suspect he knows what really happened, but he has never talked to me about it. The little I do know I've had to piece together with vague recollections and some help from history.<br>I spent my earliest years in the rolling countryside of northeastern Cambodia, surrounded by savanna and forests, not far from the high plains of Vietnam. Even today, when I have the chance to go into the forest, I feel at home. I recognize smells. I recognize plants. I instinctively know what's good to eat and what's poisonous. I remember the waterfalls. The sound of them is still in my ears. We children would bathe naked under the cascading water and play at holding our breath. I remember the smell of the virgin forest. I have a buried memory of this place.<br>The people of Bou Sra, the village where I was born, are Phnong. They are an old tribe of mountain people, quite unlike the Khmer who dominate the lowlands of Cambodia. I have inherited the typical Phnong dark skin from my mother. Cambodians see it as black and ugly. In Khmer, the word "Phnong" means "savage." Throughout Southeast Asia, people are very sensitive about skin color. The paler you are, the closer to "moon color," the more highly you are prized. A plump woman with white skin is the supreme object of beauty and desire. I was dark and thin and very unattractive.<br>I was born sometime around 1970 or 1971, when the Troubles began in Cambodia. My parents left me with my maternal grandmother when I was still a small child. Perhaps they were seeking a better life, or perhaps they were forced to leave. Before I turned five, the country had been carpet-bombed by the Americans. Then it was seized by the murderous regime of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge. The four years of Khmer Rouge rule, from 1975 to 1979, were responsible for the deaths of about one in five people in Cambodia through execution, starvation, or forced labor. In the storm of events, countless others were simply swept away from their villages and families without leaving a trace. People were displaced to work camps, where they toiled as slaves, or were forced to fight for the regime. There are many reasons why my parents might have left the forest.<br>The story I like to tell myself is that my parents and grandmother always had my best interests at heart. Among the Phnong, the mother's lineage determines ethnicity. So despite my father being Khmer, when my parents left, my place was with the Phnong in Mondulkiri Province. Not long thereafter my grandmother would also disappear, much too soon for me to have any lasting memory of her. Mountain people up and leave for any old reason, as soon as anything displeases them. No one expected an explanation, especially not during those troubled years. So when my grandmother left the forest, no one knew where she went. I don't think I was abandoned--she probably thought I'd be safest in the village. There was no way she could have known that the forest would not be my home for long.<br>Our village was nothing more than a dozen round huts clustered in a forest clearing. The huts were made of plaited bamboo, their straw roofs low to the ground. Most families shared a single large hut with no partition between the communal sleeping platform and the cooking area. Other families kept themselves separate. With no parents or other family in the village, I would sleep on my own in a hammock. I lived like a little savage. I slept here or there, and ate where I could. I was at home everywhere and nowhere. I don't remember any other children who slept alone among the trees, as I did. Perhaps I wasn't taken in by anyone because I was of mixed race--part Phnong and part Khmer. Or perhaps I just made a decision to be by myself. Being an orphan in Cambodia is no rare condition. It is frighteningly ordinary.<br>I wasn't generally unhappy, but I remember feeling cold all the time. On particularly bitter or rainy nights, a kind man, Taman, would make space for me in his home. He was a Cham, a Muslim Khmer, but his wife was Phnong. I can't remember her name, but I thought she was beautiful with her long black hair tied behind her head with a bamboo stick, her high cheekbones, and a necklace made of shiny black wood and animal teeth. She was nice to me. Sometimes she would try to wash my long hair, rubbing the ash of a special herb into it to clean it, and then oiling it with pig fat and combing it with her fingers while she sang. She wore an intricately woven black and red cloth around her waist. Some women would leave their breasts bare, but Taman's wife covered hers.<br>Taman, like the other men, wore a loincloth that left his buttocks bare. The men wore strings of beads and bows strapped to their backs and had thick cylinders of wood pierced through their earlobes.<br>We children would be naked most of the time. We would play or help make clothes together out of thick, flat leaves wrapped with vines. Taman's wife would weave for hours on end, sitting on the floor with her legs stretched out in front of her and the bamboo loom tied to her feet.<br>Her teeth were filed into sharp points. Phnong girls file and blacken their teeth when they become women, but I left the village long before the time for filing teeth.<br>I was always looking for a mother so that I could be held in her arms, kissed, and stroked, like Taman's wife held her children. I was very unhappy not to have a mother like everyone else. My only confidants were the trees. I talked to them and told them about my sorrow. They listened, understood, and made discreet signs in my direction. They were my only true friends, along with the moon. When things got unbearable, I confessed my secrets to the waterfalls, because the water couldn't reverse its flow and betray me. Even today, I sometimes talk to trees. Other than that, I almost never spoke as a child. There wouldn't have been much point--nobody would have listened.<br>I found my own food. I would roam the forest and eat what I could find: fruit, wild vegetables, and honey. There were also plenty of insects, such as grasshoppers and ants, to eat. I particularly loved the ants. I still know where to look to find fruits and berries, and I still know that there are bees you can follow to find their honey. And I still know that you should look down because there are mushrooms on the ground, but also snakes.<br>If I caught an animal I would take it to Taman's wife to cook. She cooked meat under a layer of ash, because ash is naturally salty. Sometimes she dried the little pieces of meat in buffalo dung, mixed them with bitter herbs and rice, and cooked them over the fire. The first time I returned to the village as an adult, almost twenty-five years later, I discovered that dish again and I ate so much I made myself sick.<br>The mountain land in the Mondulkiri region was ill suited for growing rice, so the entire village had to work together to grow our food. The forest had to be burned to create rice paddies. Every few years, the forest had to be burned so we could grow rice, and we would be forced to go farther and farther afield in search of good soil. The distances were vast, especially for my little legs, and sometimes we'd have to walk for several days. We had no carts or work animals like the Khmer had in their flooded rice paddies. Everything we brought back to the village we had to carry ourselves.<br>When the rice was harvested, several villages would gather around a fire to celebrate. We would sacrifice a buffalo to the spirits who lived in the forest and dance to the beat of the metal gongs. There'd be endless banqueting and lots of rice wine. I remember the earthenware jars being enormous, almost as tall as I was. We'd drink it straight from the jar, one by one, sipping through a bamboo straw. Even children were allowed to join in. I remember a great deal of kindness toward the children on these occasions. The Phnong people are good to children--not like the Khmer.<br>Our hills were so remote that probably no doctor or nurse had ever set foot in them. There were certainly no schools. I never saw a Buddhist or Christian preacher. And although my childhood coincided with the Khmer Rouge regime, I also have no recollection of ever seeing soldiers.<br>The Khmer Rouge had decreed that mountain people like the Phnong were "core people." We were examples for others to follow, because we had no contact with Western habits and lived collectively. Our forest and hills protected us from the suffering that engulfed the rest of Cambodia while I was a small child.<br>Pol Pot had abolished money throughout the entire country of Cambodia, along with school diplomas, motor vehicles, eyeglasses, books, and any other sign of modern life. But I don't think that's why we had no currency. The Phnong never needed money. If the grown-ups wanted something we couldn't make or grow or hunt, they traded for it. If we wanted a cabbage, we went to ask a neighbor who had planted some. He would give us cabbage without asking for anything in return. Now it's different: the people from Phnom Penh arrive on weekends or during the holidays in their big 4_4s wit...</p><h2>Ghost Hunt, Vol. 2</h2><p>HOUSE OF HORROR<br><br>High school student Mai Taniyama, her handsome boss Kazuya Shibuya (aka Naru), and other members of Shibuya Psychic Research are now tackling the eerie case of the Morishita family. What is the tragic story hidden within the Morishitas&#x2019; old house? Is it haunted by a mischievous poltergeist, or by something far more sinister?<br><br>As Mai and Naru dig deep to uncover the home&#x2019;s dark secrets, they learn that every child who has ever lived there has died under mysterious circumstances. And they soon discover that the malevolent forces at the house have a disturbing face: the creepy smile of Ayami Morishita&#x2019;s doll. Of course, destroying a child&#x2019;s toy should be a simple matter, right?</p><p>Grade 7 Up&#x2013;Enthusiastic but uninformed Mai continues to assist arrogant 16-year-old entrepreneur Naru with his paranormal investigation service. Most of the volume is taken up with a story called Doll House, in which the extended members of Shibuya Psychic Research visit a house to investigate poltergeist phenomena associated with a doll belonging to an eight-year-old girl. Effectively creepy in places, the predictable story is elevated by the visuals. However, any success is undercut by the solution that allows Naru to finally dispel the malevolent spirit. As with the first volume, readers are given no advance information about his secret weapon. So while the story is visually effective, it lacks drama. Furthermore, this particular bag of tricks begins to make the supporting characters seem less valuable and, in retrospect, makes their earlier efforts at exorcism seem like a waste of readers time. The last chapter, a side story, maneuvers the characters closer to the standard manga love triangle farce that will undoubtedly feature heavily in future volumes.<i>&#x2013;Benjamin Russell, The Derryfield School, Manchester, NH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this wonderfully colorful and surprising history, Herbert Asbury expands his purview beyond the Five Corners to the entire city of New York.

Sullivan), All Around the Town brings to vivid life a memorable range of characters, grifters, murderers, and madmen.

How can we reinvent religion so that it liberates us instead of consoling us?</p><p>These questions stand at the center of Roberto Mangabeira Unger's <i>The Religion of the Future</i>. Both a book about religion and a religious work in its own right, it proposes the content of a religion that can survive faith in a transcendent God and in life after death. According to this religion--the religion of the future--human beings can be more human by becoming more godlike, not just later, in another life or another time, but right now, on Earth and in their own lives.</p><p>Unger begins by facing the irreparable flaws in the human condition: our mortality, groundlessness, and insatiability. He goes on to discuss the conflicting approaches to existence that have dominated the last 2,500 years of the history of religion. Turning next to the religious revolution that we now require, he explores the political ideal of this revolution, an idea of deep freedom. And he develops its moral vision, focused on a refusal to squander life.</p><p><i>The Religion of the Future</i> advances Unger's philosophical program: a philosophy for which history is open, the new can happen, and belittlement need not be our fate.</p></p><p>Roberto Mangabeira Unger is the Roscoe Pound Professor of Law at Harvard University.A vital and moving philosophy of human potential.

Soft cover, 384 pp. 2nd printing. Black and white photographs and illustrations throughout. [From Publisher&#39;s summary] The first comprehensive, accurately researched history of Los Angeles, through its architecture and building, since the 1950s. Through well-researched historic depictions, colorful anecdotes, and 180 quality photographs, Los Angeles: The End of the Rainbow explores a city&#39;s attraction to newcomers as evidenced in its domestic architecture. [From front jacket flap] HAVE YOU EVER SEEN images of the Spanish, Tudor and French Normandy concoctions that line Los Angeles streets and wondered how L.A. got so style crazy? Los Angeles: The End of the Rainbow profiles the city&#39;s cultural history using its houses as historical artifacts. It tells us about the dreams of men and women who poured into the L.A. Basin in boom periods and continued to trickle in in spite of hard times and natural disasters. From the thatched dwellings of Native Americans to present day condominiums, from the tent cities of the homeless to the mansions of oil magnates, colorful anecdotal accounts trace the development of the city in its political, economic and social settings. The reader will develop an appreciation for L.A.&#39;s long heritage of mixed races and cultures and the unique combination of factors influencing its streetscape. As the story unfolds it becomes clear that the cycle of real estate boom and bust, newcomers rejecting the next wave of immigrants, cults and off beat political parties are not just momentary phenomena but an ongoing way of life. With this historical perspective today&#39;s urban citizens and politicians can learn much about living in any increasingly diverse city of the future.</p><p></p><h2>John Mullan: The Tumultuous Life of a Western Road Builder</h2><p><p>John Mullan's celebrated road, a 625-mile link that connected the Missouri and Columbia rivers and eventually became a significant component of Interstate 90, established the West Point graduate as an accomplished engineer.

After completing the West's first engineered highway at age thirty-two, he lived for nearly another half century, a period of dynamic change. When he died in1909, automobiles were making their initial crossings along the route he engineered, and his arterial eventually became a critical link in America's longest interstate freeway, I-90. Yet despite frequent mentions in books about the nineteenth century Northwest, the soldier/explorer has remained little more than a caricature: a dashing young Army officer who comes West, builds one of its most important thoroughfares, and then disappears from the region's literature. <p> Now, in lively prose, Idaho State Historian Keith Petersen takes a fresh look at Mullan's road, which has significantly impacted the development of the Northwest for more than 150 years. The deeply researched biography also probes Mullan's complex personality and continues the story, including business partnerships and personal relationships with some of the West's most intriguing characters: Father Pierre-Jean DeSmet, General William T. Sherman, Chico founder John Bidwell, Idaho gold discoverer Elias Pierce, Yakama Indian chief Owhi, and others. Long overdue, Petersen's comprehensive portrayal bestows a full appreciation of Mullan's life--his rise to fame as well as his fall from grace.</p>Keith C.

In 1941, 14-year-old Dalia and her family are deported from their native Lithuania to a labour camp in Siberia. As the strongest member of her family she submits to twelve hours a day of manual labour. At the age of 21, she escapes the gulag and returns to Lithuania. She writes her memories on scraps of paper and buries them in the garden, fearing they might be discovered by the KGB. They are not found until 1991, four years after her death. This is the story Dalia buried. The immediacy of her writing bears witness not only to the suffering she endured but also the hope that sustained her. It is a Lithuanian tale that, like its author, beats the odds to survive. &#39;There is only one word to describe this book: Extraordinary. It blew me away when I first read it in German translation. Dalia&#39;s account goes far beyond a memoir. This is an outstanding piece of literature which should be read by anyone who wishes to understand the Soviet repression.&#39; Meike Ziervogel, Peirene Press Publisher</p><p>Dalia Grinkeviciute (1927-1987) was born in Kaunas, the former capital of Lithuania.

Their leader, the last to die and the man whose diary described their agonies was Robert Falcon Scott. The expedition had been beaten to the Pole by a band of racing Norwegians, led by Roald Amundsen. The bodies of the last three to die were found seven months later and, ever since, Scott's men have been British heroes. It is that legend, as much as their ordeal that is the subject of this book. Scott's men and the supporting characters, Amundsen and Shackleton, his rivals; Clement Markham, his discoverer; his wife Kathleen&#x2014;give a fascinating picture of English society before the First World War. The story of the drama becomes also an illustration of human and social character. And, to the extent that Scott is legendary in England, the book tells something about the English and their attitude to duty.</p><p><b>David Thomson</b> is the author of A Biographical Dictionary of Film and many other books including Showman: The Life of David O. Selznick, Rosebud: The Story of Orson Welles, and In Nevada. He lives in San Francisco.Twenty-five years after its first publication, Thomson's myth-shattering chronicle of the Antarctic expeditions of Robert Falcon Scott is republished with a new title (it was originally called <i>Scott's Men</i>). The bibliography has been beefed up, and the author has incorporated a few references to discoveries made in the intervening years, but basically it's the same book. That's not a bad thing in this case. The long out-of-print original is just as eye-opening a book now as it was a quarter century ago. Thomson, a noted film critic and historian, reveals that Scott, who emerged from his disastrous 1901-04 expedition to the South Pole as an international hero, was not quite as heroic as he was made out to be. Similarly, Thomson looks behind the myth of Scott's rival Roald Amundsen and finds an explorer whose "lust for popular glory" led him to take unwarranted risks. Finally, Thomson reveals that friction between Scott and Ernest Shackleton led to Shackleton's own ill-fated (and recently much chronicled) polar adventures.

What makes us live, buy, even love as we do? The answers are in the codes.<br><br>In <i>The Culture Code</i>, internationally revered cultural anthropologist and marketing expert Clotaire Rapaille reveals for the first time the techniques he has used to improve profitability and practices for dozens of Fortune 100 companies. His groundbreaking revelations shed light not just on business but on the way every human being acts and lives around the world. <br><br>Rapaille&#x2019;s breakthrough notion is that we acquire a silent system of Codes as we grow up within our culture. These Codes&#x2014;the Culture Code&#x2014;are what make us American, or German, or French, and they invisibly shape how we behave in our personal lives, even when we are completely unaware of our motives. What&#x2019;s more, we can learn to crack the Codes that guide our actions and achieve new understanding of why we do the things we do. <br><br>Rapaille has used the Culture Code to help Chrysler build the PT Cruiser&#x2014;the most successful American car launch in recent memory. He has used it to help Procter &amp; Gamble design its advertising campaign for Folger&#x2019;s coffee &#x2013; one of the longest-lasting and most successful campaigns in the annals of advertising. He has used it to help companies as diverse as GE, AT&amp;T, Boeing, Honda, Kellogg, and L&#x2019;Or�al improve their bottom line at home and overseas. And now, in <i>The Culture Code</i>, he uses it to reveal why Americans act distinctly like Americans, and what makes us different from the world around us. <br><br>In <i>The Culture Code</i>, Dr. Rapaille decodes two dozen of our most fundamental archetypes&#x2014;ranging from sex to money to health to America itself&#x2014;to give us &#x201c;a new set of glasses&#x201d; with which to view our actions and motivations. Why are we so often disillusioned by love? Why is fat a solution rather than a problem? Why do we reject the notion of perfection? Why is fast food in our lives to stay? The answers are in the Codes. <br><br>Understanding the Codes gives us unprecedented freedom over our lives. It lets us do business in dramatically new ways. And it finally explains why people around the world really <i>are</i> different, and reveals the hidden clues to understanding us all.</p><p><p>Dr. CLOTAIRE RAPAILLE is the chairman of Archetype Discoveries Worldwide and has used this decoding approach for thirty years. He is the personal adviser to ten high-ranking CEOs and is kept on retainer by fifty Fortune 100 companies. He has been profiled in many national media outlets, including <i>60 Minutes II</i> and on the front page of the <i>New York Times</i> Sunday Styles section. He lives in Tuxedo Park, New York.</p><b><i>From the </i>Introduction<i> to </i>The Culture Code<i><br></i></b><br>The Culture Code is the unconscious meaning we apply to any given thing &#x2014; a car, a type of food, a relationship, even a country &#x2014; via the culture in which we are raised. The American experience with Jeeps is very different from the French and German experience because our cultures evolved differently (we have strong cultural memories of the open frontier; the French and Germans have strong cultural memories of occupation and war). Therefore, the Codes &#x2014; the meaning we give to the Jeep at an unconscious level &#x2014; are different as well. The reasons for this are numerous (and I will describe them in the next chapter), but it all comes down to the worlds in which we grew up. It is obvious to everyone that cultures are different from one another. What most people don&#x2019;t realize, however, is that these differences actually lead to our processing the same information in different ways. <br><br>My journey toward the discovery of cultural codes began in the early 1970&#x2019;s. I was a psychoanalyst in Paris at the time, and my clinical work brought me to the research of the great scientist Henri Laborit, who drew a clear connection between learning and emotion, showing that without the latter the former was impossible. The stronger the emotion, the more clearly an experience is learned. Think of a child told by his parents to avoid a hot pan on a stove. This concept is abstract to the child until he reaches out, touches the pan, and it burns him. In this intensely emotional moment of pain, the child learns what &#x201c;hot&#x201d; and &#x201c;burn&#x201d; means and is very unlikely ever to forget it.<br><br>The combination of the experience and its accompanying emotion create something known widely (and coined as such by Konrad Lorenz) as an imprint. Once an imprint occurs, it strongly conditions our thought processes and shapes our future actions. Each imprint helps make us more of who we are. The combination of these imprints defines us. <br><br>One of my most memorable personal imprints came when I was a young boy. I grew up in France, and when I was about four years old, my family received an invitation to a wedding. I&#x2019;d never been to one before and I had no idea what to expect. What I encountered was remarkable. French weddings are unlike weddings in any other culture I know. The event went on for two days, nearly all of which was spent around a large communal table. People stood at the table to offer toasts. They stood on<i> </i>the table to sing songs. They slept under the table and (as I later learned) even seduced one another under the table. Food was always available. People drank <i>le trou Normand</i>, a glass of Calvados that allowed them to make room for more food. Others simply went to the bathroom to vomit so they could eat more. It was an amazing thing to see as a child and it left a permanent imprint on me. Forever more, I would always associate weddings with gustatory excess. In fact, the first time I went to a wedding in America, I was taken aback by how sedate it was in comparison. Recently, when I remarried, my wife (who also grew up in France) and I held the kind of multi-day feast that meant &#x201c;wedding&#x201d; to both of us. <br><br>Every imprint influences us on an unconscious level. When the work of Laborit crystallized this for me, I began to incorporate what I learned from him into my clinical work in Paris, most of which was being done with autistic children (in fact, Laborit led me to the theory that autistic children do not learn effectively because they lack the emotion to do so). The subject of imprinting also formed the foundation of the lectures I gave during this time. After one particular lecture at Geneva University, the father of a student approached me.<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Rapaille, I might have a client for you,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Always intrigued at the possibilities offered by another case, I nodded with interest. &#x201c;An autistic child?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said, smiling, &#x201c;Nestl�.&#x201d; <br><br>At the time, focused on clinical and scholarly work, I barely understood what the word &#x201c;marketing&#x201d; meant. I therefore couldn&#x2019;t possibly imagine what use I would be to a corporation. &#x201c;Nestl�? What can I do for them?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;We are trying to sell instant coffee in Japan, but we aren&#x2019;t having as much success as we would like. Your work on imprints might be very helpful to us.&#x201d;<br><br>We continued to talk and the man made me an extremely attractive offer. Not only were the financial terms considerable, but there was something promising about a project like this. Unlike my work with autistic children, where progress was painfully slow, this offer was a chance to quickly test theories I had developed about imprinting and the unconscious mind. It was an opportunity too good to pass up. I took a sabbatical and went off on my new assignment.<br><br>My first meeting with Nestl� executives and their Japanese advertising agency was very instructive. Their strategy, which today seems absurdly wrong but wasn&#x2019;t as clear-cut in the &#x2018;70s, was to try to convince Japanese consumers to switch from tea to coffee. Having spent some time in Japan previously, I knew that tea meant a great deal to this culture, but I had no sense of what emotions they attached to coffee. I decided to gather several groups of people together to discover how they imprinted the beverage. I believed there was a message there that could open a door for Nestl�.<br><br>I structured a three-hour session with each of the groups. In the first hour, I took on the persona of a visitor from another planet, someone who had never seen coffee before and had no idea how one &#x201c;used&#x201d; it. I asked for help understanding the product, believing their descriptions would give me insight into what they thought of it. <br><br>In the next hour, I had them sit on the floor like elementary school children and use scissors and a pile of magazines to make a collage of words about coffee. The goal here was to get them to tell me stories with these words that would offer me further clues. <br><br>In the third hour, I had participants lie on the floor with pillows. There was some hesitation among members of every group, but I convinced them I wasn&#x2019;t entirely out of my mind. I put on soothing music and asked the participants to relax. What I was doing was calming their active brain waves, getting them to that tranquil point just before sleep. When they reached this state, I took them on a journey back from their adulthood, past their teenage years, to a time when they were very young. Once they arrived, I asked them to think again about coffee and to recall their earliest memory of it, the first time they consciously experienced it and, if it was different, their most significant memory of it.<br><br>I designed this process to bring participants back to their first imprint of coffee and the emotion attached to it. In most cases, though, the journey led nowhere. What this signified for Nestl� was very clear. While the Japanese had an extremely strong emotional connection to tea (something I learned without asking in the first hour of the sessions), they had at the most a very superficial imprint of coffee. Most, in fact, had no imprint of coffee at all. <br><br>Under these circumstances, Nestl�&#x2019;s strategy of getting these consumers to switch from tea to coffee could only fail. Coffee could not compete with tea in the Japanese culture if it had such weak emotional resonance. Instead, if Nestl� was going to have any success in this market at all, they needed to start at the beginning. They needed to give the product meaning in this culture. They needed to create an imprint for coffee for the Japanese.<br><br>Armed with this information, Nestl� devised a new strategy. Rather than selling instant coffee to a country dedicated to tea, they created desserts for children infused with the flavor of coffee but without the caffeine. The younger generation embraced these desserts. Their first imprint of coffee was a very positive one, one they would carry throughout their lives. Through this, Nestl� gained a meaningful foothold in the Japanese market. Understanding the process of imprinting &#x2014; and how it related directly to Nestl�&#x2019;s marketing efforts &#x2014; unlocked a door to the Japanese culture for them and turned around a floundering business venture. <br><br>It did something much more important for me, however. The realization that there was no significant imprint for coffee in Japan underscored for me that early imprinting has a tremendous impact on why people do what they do. In addition, the fact that the Japanese did not have a strong imprint for coffee while the Swiss (Nestl� is a Swiss company) obviously did made it clear that imprints vary from culture to culture. If I could get to the source of these imprints &#x2014; if I could somehow &#x201c;decode&#x201d; elements of culture to discover the emotions and meanings attached to them &#x2014; I would learn a great deal about human behavior and how it varies across the planet. This set me on the course of my life&#x2019;s work. I went off in search of the codes hidden within the unconscious of every culture.<br><b><i>From </i>Chapter Two:<i><br> The Growing Pains of an <br>Adolescent Culture: The Codes for Love, Seduction and Sex<br></i></b><br>As you will learn throughout this book, the American culture exhibits many of the traits consistent with adolescence: intense focus on &#x201c;the now,&#x201d; dramatic mood swings, constant need for exploration and challenge to authority, a fascination with extremes, openness to change and reinvention, and a strong belief that mistakes warrant second chances.

As a child, she struggled with reading and writing. But by third grade, after spending much time in her public library in Portland, Oregon, she found her skills had greatly improved. Before long, her school librarian was saying that she should write children's books when she grew up.</p><p>Instead she became a librarian. When a young boy asked her, "Where are the books about kids like us?" she remembered her teacher's encouragement and was inspired to write the books she'd longed to read but couldn't find when she was younger. She based her funny stories on her own neighborhood experiences and the sort of children she knew. And so, the Klickitat Street gang was born!</p><p>Mrs. Cleary's books have earned her many prestigious awards, including the American Library Association's Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, presented to her in recognition of her lasting contribution to children's literature. <em>Dear Mr. Henshaw</em> won the Newbery Medal, and <em>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</em> and <em>Ramona and Her Father</em> have been named Newbery Honor Books. Her characters, including Beezus and Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, and Ralph, the motorcycle-riding mouse, have delighted children for generations.</p>Chapter One<p></p><p>Emily Goes to the Post Office</p><p>The things that happened to Emily Bartlett that year!</p><p>It seemed to Emily that it all began one bright spring day, a day meant for adventure. The weather was so warm Mama had let her take off her long stockings and put on her half socks for the first time since last fall. Breezes on her knees after a winter of stockings always made Emily feel as frisky as a spring lamb. The field that Emily could see from the kitchen window had turned blue with wild forget-me-nots and down in the pasture the trees, black silhouettes trimmed with abandoned bird nests throughout the soggy winter, were suddenly turning green.</p><p>Everywhere sap was rising, and Emily felt as if it was rising in her, too. This made it difficult for her to sit still long enough to write to her cousin Muriel, who lived in Portland and had so many wonderful things--things like fleece-lined bedroom slippers with kittens on the toes, cement sidewalks to roller skate on, and a public library full of books. </p><p>"Finish your letter, Emily," said Mama, who was scrubbing out milk pans at the kitchen sink while the washing machine churned away on the back porch. "Then you can take it to the post office." </p><p>Emily looked up from her letter. "Mama, I just know something wonderful is going to happen today," she said. "I can feel it in my bones." </p><p>Mama laughed. "Adventure is pretty scarce here in Pitchfork. I think your imagination is running away with you."</p><p>Mama often said this and whenever she did, Emily could just see herself hanging on for dear life in a buggy pulled pell-mell down Main Street by a frightened horse, the way a horse once ran away with Mama when she first came out West to teach school. All Mama's hairpins came out, her long black hair came tumbling down around her shoulders, and by the time someone stopped the horse she was a sight. Emily was always sorry she could not have been there to see the horse run away with Mama the way her imagination was supposed to run away with her.</p><p>Emily read Muriel's letter once more.</p><p>Dear Emily,<br>This week I went to the library. I got Black Beauty. It is about a horse. It is the best book I ever read. I read it three times. I have to go now. Write soon. </p>Yours truly,<br>Muriel<br><p>P.S. Mama sends her love.</p><p>It was not an easy letter to answer. Muriel was always writing about the library books she read--books like <i>Heidi</i> and <i>Toby Tyler,</i> which Emily had never even seen. Aunt Irene, Muriel's mother, said Muriel was a regular little bookworm.</p><p>Emily did not envy Muriel the fleece-lined bedroom slippers or the cement sidewalk for roller skating, but she did envy her that library. She longed to be a bookworm, although she did not think she would care to be called one. Unfortunately, the town of Pitchfork, Oregon, did not have a library. Oh, there were things to read--the Burgess Bedtime Story in the newspaper,&nbsp;Elson <i>Reader Book IV,</i> and the Sunday-school paper, but none of these qualified Emily to be a bookworm. Emily was not lucky like Muriel, who could ride a streetcar downtown to a big library full of hundreds, even thousands, of books, although of course Emily was lucky in other ways.</p><p>Emily was lucky because of Mama, who right now was sitting down to rest her feet while the washing machine did its work out on the back porch, Mama was so little she always wore high heels, even though she had a great big house to take care of. Tap-tap-tap went her heels all day long. Once, three years ago, during the war, when Mama had been an Honor Guard girl and had marched in a parade to get people to buy Liberty Bonds, she had&nbsp;lost one of her heels right in the middle of the parade, but that did not stop Mama. She had marched tap-bump, tap-bump all the way down Main Street to help sell Liberty Bonds. Mama had spunk.</p><p>It was funny about Mama's being so small, because Daddy was big and strong and handsome. Once when he was just out of high school, some men came out from Portland and told Daddy he should be a prize fighter, but, Daddy said, no, thank you, he would rather be a farmer. This was lucky, because sometimes when Emily got into an argument with one of the girls at school, she settled it by saying, "My father could have been a prize fighter if he'd wanted to, but he didn't want to. So there!" </p><p>Emily was lucky in her ancestors, too. They had been pioneers, and whenever things were hard, Mama always said, "Remember&nbsp;your pioneer ancestors." Emily had always liked the stories of their trip across the plains in their covered wagons. Now Emily's pioneer ancestors were all dead and buried in the weedy little cemetery called Mountain Rest, but she did have Grandpa and Grandma Slater, Mama's parents, right here in Pitchfork. </p><p>Emily was lucky in many ways. She was lucky in the house she lived in, a house with three balconies, a cupola, banisters just right for sliding down, and the second bathtub in Yamhill County. Emily did not know who owned the first bathtub, but having the second bathtub was still pretty important. It showed that their house, known as the old Bartlett place, was very old.</p></p><h2>Benny the Beaver</h2><p>Pictorial children&#39;s book.</p><p></p><h2>Seasonal Occult Rituals</h2><p>Seasonal rites are as old as the hills on which they were once practised by most of humanity. Periodically, in accordance with the natural tides of nature and the times indicated by the sun and moon, people came together to make dedicated representations of the things that bound them closest to the cosmic wheel of life. In this absorbing work, William G. Gray demonstrates the continuing relevance of such practices in modern society. The actions of the rites are performed in a circle which symbolises the cosmic course, the magical practices consisting of music, movement, meditation and meaning. Detailed scripts are given for conducting the quarterly rites of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, with complete texts of the chants, songs and invocations for each season. Seasonal Occult Rituals was originally published in 1970, now available again for the first time in forty years. &#34;A welcome and valuable addition to the literature of Western occultism ... clear and without pretentiousness.&#34; - Doreen Valiente</p><p></p><h2>Workshop Idea Book (Taunton Woodworking)</h2><p>A woodworking shop is always a &#34;work-in-progress,&#34; often rearranged dozens of times to make improvements or to accommodate specific tasks. Woodworkers are always looking for ways to make the shop better, more efficient, and friendlier to use. Not being part of the living space of the house, a shop is often in an area with physical challenges, such as low head room in a basement shop or the need to work around a difficult floor plan. Specialized woodworking tasks require different shop configurations and different tooling and a different strategy for layout or accessories. This book uses the popular idea book format to address these many challenges, showing a wide variety of clever ideas and solutions for basics such as tool storage, lumber storage, accessorizing workbenches for special tasks, dedicated workstations.</p><p>Andy Rae worked with George Nakashima and Frank Klausz before founding his own woodworking business.

And is eating that extra sausage going to kill you? We've all heard the statistics for risky activities, but what do they mean in the real world? In <i>The Norm Chronicles</i>, journalist Michael Blastland and risk expert David Spiegelhalter explore these questions through the stories of average Norm and an ingenious measurement called the MicroMorta - a one-in-a-million chance of dying. They reveal why general anesthesia is as dangerous as a parachute jump, giving birth in the US is nearly twice as risky as in the UK, and that the radiation from eating a banana shaves three seconds off your life. An entertaining guide to the statistics of personal risk, <i>The Norm Chronicles</i> will enlighten anyone who has ever worried about the dangers we encounter in our daily lives. </p></p><p><b>Michael Blastland</b> is an author, journalist, and BBC Radio 4 broadcaster.

But the authors take a different tack a better one. They argue ably that mathematical computations should be a buttress to our judgment but concede that computations will never, and should never, replace our judgment entirely. Of their risk-buffeted characters, they conclude: We don't know how to use data to tell them how to live.' If they don't, no one does.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br> A cheerfully subversive variation on the genre.

It's also a paradox a book about numbers and probabilities that'll keep you hooked to the last page. That shouldn't be possible. Using master story telling and a large dose of humanity, Blastland and Spiegelhalter transform the statistics of danger and death into a celebration of life.

As a western army wife Frances Roe found herself in the shadow of the Rockies&#x2014;Lt. Roe was stationed at Piegan Agency, Montana Territory, as well as in the Cheyenne country of Colorado and Indian Territory&#x2014;and her book is filled with the beauty of the wilderness. She records the problems of camp and garrison life with servants, sand, and shortages, and the pleasures of parties and new friends, of hunting, fishing, and camping trips, and of long romps with her dog Hal. One chapter reports a fine summer's outing to twelve-year-old Yellowstone National Park in 1884.&nbsp;In the cavalcade of men's western memoirs, books written by frontier women have too often gone unheralded and almost unnoticed. Yet women were among the keenest observers of the nineteenth-century West and its inhabitants, as seen nowhere better than in Frances Roe's vivid account of life with the western army.</p><p>Sandra L.

There was nothing surreal or false about it; the facts were always the same, always accurate. It's night. I'm moving up on the scene. The armed suspect steps out of the convenience store. I see him. He sees me. I say, "Police. Drop the gun. Put your hands in the air." He raises his gun to shoot me. I fire first. The force of the 12-gauge hurls him back against the glass doors. Over and over and over again. I dreamed the dream quite often after the shooting, sometimes twice a night. Later, it became a couple of times a week, then a couple of times a month. I couldn't remember the last time I had the dream. Not for a few years anyway. Then they put me in jail. <br>What happened was I got lost. I was trying to navigate the residential streets of Coon Rapids, a third ring suburb north of Minneapolis. Meyer wanted to sell his seventy-five-year-old eight-chair, hand-carved dining room set with matching buffet, and I wanted to buy. I needed a dining room set. I liked throwing elaborate dinner parties for my friends, but I always had to squeeze them around a small kitchen table, and I wasn't so good a cook I could keep getting away with it. Only the directions Meyer gave me were confused. Either that or I was confused. It was hard to tell which. <br>I was cruising slowly, trying to find a street sign that would match the words written on the crumpled piece of paper in my hand, when a woman appeared in the street, waving her arms frantically. I stopped. Of course I stopped. I'm from Minnesota, and like most Minnesotans, I'm a helluva nice guy. <br>The woman staggered to my open window. She stood with both hands pressed against the side of my silver Audi. I powered the window down. <br>"Help me," she said. <br>"Help you?" <br>"Help me, please." <br>"Help you what?" <br>The woman was small and thin, in her forties, with dull brown eyes and long stringy hair that might have been brown. She looked like she hadn't bathed in weeks. Smelled like it, too. <br>"It's my boyfriend," she said. <br>"What about him?" <br>"He's dead." <br>"Really?" I couldn't believe she had said that. "Are you sure?" <br>"I don't know. I think so. Could you look for me?" <br>Hell, no! That's what my inner voice screamed. Usually I listen to it. This time I didn't. You know why? Besides being a helluva nice guy, sometimes I'm quite dim. <br>"Listen," I told the woman. "Just stay there, okay? Don't move. Just stay there." <br>I parked the Audi on the wrong side of the street in front of the house the woman pointed at. <br>"He was so good-looking," she said. "And charming. Very nice manners." <br>It was seventy-four degrees inside my car and ninety-seven degrees and humid outside. The difference snapped my head back. <br>"We were going to be married," the woman added. "I guess the wedding's off now." <br>"Where is your boyfriend?" <br>She sat down on the grass boulevard facing my vehicle and pulled her knees to her chest. "I thought he was the one." <br>"Miss?" <br>She began rocking from side to side while she stared at her distorted reflection in the door. She was wearing white pants and a white shirt. Both were stained with feces, urine, and, I was guessing, dried blood. There appeared to be feces and blood on her bare feet as well. <br>"Ma'am?" <br>She flung a hand over her shoulder toward the house. It was one of those $120,000 starter homes that people stay in for thirty years, a rambler with attached garage. I left her sitting by the Audi and followed the narrow, S-shaped concrete path to the front door. The door was open. A heavy odor of decaying garbage greeted me six paces before I reached it. I looked inside through the screen. A body dressed in blue jeans and a red T-shirt was sprawled in the center of the room in plain sight. No, it wasn't red. It was a white shirt soaked in dried blood. I had an unobstructed view of the man's bearded face. It seemed to be moving. I squinted. Maggots. And flies. Flies everywhere. <br>My gag reflex kicked in hard. I put my hand over my mouth and turned away. <br>The police cruiser came to a sudden halt behind my vehicle, the officer stomping on his brakes as if he were making a pit stop at Talladega. He was out of the car before his siren died away. The only thing that slowed him down was the immense wall of heat that smacked him upside the head the moment he opened the door. It had been only four minutes since I used my cell phone to call it in and already the back of my polo shirt was saturated with sweat. <br>"Baumbach, APD," he barked. <br>APD? my inner voice asked. <br>"I called the Coon Rapids Police Department," I said. <br>"This is Anoka, son." <br>No wonder I couldn't find Meyer's house. I was in the wrong city. <br>Baumbach swelled his chest and tugged at his gun belt. "What have you got?" <br>A cowboy, I told myself. I need this, I really do. Worse, he was young. He looked like a batboy for a minor league baseball team, yet he was calling me son? <br>"You have a first name?" I asked. <br>Baumbach glared at me as if I had just questioned his mother's occupation. <br>"Boyd," he snapped. <br>"Well, Boyd, it's like I told dispatch." I used my chin to point at the woman. "This woman wants to report a dead boyfriend." <br>The woman was still sitting on the grass, still staring at her reflection in my car door. <br>"Ma'am?" Baumbach asked tentatively. <br>The woman didn't answer. <br>"What's your name, ma'am? Ma'am? You reported a dead body, ma'am?" <br>No reply. <br>"Do you live here, ma'am? Is the body in the house?" <br>Still nothing. <br>Baumbach glanced up at me. <br>"I think she slipped into a fugue state," I said. <br>"A what?" <br>"A pathological condition in which a person is conscious of her actions yet has no real control over them. Kinda like sleepwalking." <br>"What do you know about it?" <br>"I read." <br>From Baumbach's expression, you'd think I had just confessed to downloading kiddie porn. He turned toward the house. <br>"I'm going in," he announced. <br>"Yeah? You do that. I'll see ya around." <br>"Where do you think you're going?" <br>"Hey, man. I've got places to go, people to see." <br>"No, no, no, no, no. You stay right here." <br>I was afraid he'd say that. <br>I attempted to lean against the Audi, but the surface was far too hot, so I just stood there, arms crossed in front of me, and waited while Baumbach followed the sidewalk to the woman's house. He opened the front door, stared for a few moments, then quickly closed it without going inside. A moment later he crossed the lawn, moving quickly in a straight line, stopping only when he reached his police cruiser. He braced himself against the hood with both hands, ignoring the heat. He seemed to have trouble catching his breath. Beads of sweat trickled from his hairline and down his jaw. I was willing to bet that the Kevlar vest he wore and the nineteen pounds of equipment he carried were beginning to feel very heavy indeed. <br>Officer Baumbach stood that way for a full thirty seconds, trying to fill his deflated lungs with air. Finally, he turned to look at the woman. His mouth worked as if he wanted to ask her something. She was still staring at her reflection. Silent. I watched a maggot slither across her bare foot. Baumbach saw it, too. It was too much for him. He moved between the police cruiser and the Audi. Using the bumpers for support, he hurled both his breakfast and lunch into the street. <br>"You okay?" I asked. <br>"No, I'm not okay." After he stopped retching, Baumbach wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. He glared at the woman. "What did you do?" <br>The woman glanced up at him, shielding her eyes from the bright sun with the flat of her hand. <br>Baumbach swooped down on her, grasped her shoulders, and yanked her to her feet. "What did you do?" he said. <br>"Hey," I said. <br>Baumbach shook the woman fiercely. "What did you do?" He shoved her backward. The back of her head thudded against the Audi, and she slid slowly to the ground. She didn't make a sound. <br>"What are you, nuts?" I pushed myself between them. "Stop it." <br>"Don't interfere," he shouted back, shoving me hard for emphasis. <br>"Do it by the book. Secure the scene. Call CID. Then get the hell out of the way. What's the matter with you?" <br>"Did you see that guy? Did you?" From the look on his face I guessed the closest Baumbach had come to real tragedy was watching driver's ed films in high school. <br>"He could have died of diphtheria, you don't know," I said. <br>Baumbach grabbed the woman's collar and dragged her away from the car. <br>"Why did you kill him?" he said. <br>The woman didn't say. <br>"Answer me!" <br>When she didn't, Baumbach gave her a quick backhand across the mouth. It wasn't a vicious blow, but it certainly got my attention. <br>"That's enough," I said. <br>I chopped hard at his wrist with the edge of my hand, and Baumbach released the woman. He stepped back and rubbed the spot where I hit him, his breath coming hard, an expression of utter astonishment on his face. <br>"I'm a cop," he said. <br>"Really? How long have you been on the job? Six minutes? Kid, you're out of control. Think about what you're doing." <br>Baumbach rested his hand on the butt of his gun. <br>"No one is going to hold it against you if you just sit tight and wait for the adults to arrive," I said. <br>"I'm the police officer," he said. "I'm in charge. Now turn around," he ordered. <br>"Look, pal, I'm trying to help you. I really am." <br>His fingers tightened around the butt, and for a moment I thought he was going to pull it. <br>"I said turn around." <br>I turned. He shoved me hard against the Audi. <br>"Assume the position." <br>I assumed, pressing my hands on the hot roof of the car. <br>"You're under arrest," he told me as he wound the cuffs around my wrists, pinning my arms behind me. <br>"What's the charge?" <br>"Assaulting a police officer. Obstruction of justice." <br>"Oh, for chrissake." <br>"You think this is funny?" <br>"A little bit, yeah." <br>"You won't think it's so funny when you're locked in a cell." <br>"Seriously, kid. How long have you been on the job?" <br>"Three weeks, if you must know." <br>"And they let you out alone?" <br>"Three weeks since my probation period ended." <br>Somehow I didn't think his field-training officers had given him a lot of sevens. <br>"Let me guess," I said. "You're bored, right? You thought the job was going to be like Law &amp; Order or CSI, or maybe even NYPD Blue, right? Yet all you do most days is sit on the shoulder of 169, shooting your radar gun at passing motorists, hoping you can find just cause to make someone blow into the PBT. Right? Only now you have something worth doing. You're thinking, yeah, the guy in there, probably he's just a medical--someone who woke up dead--unless maybe, just maybe, you caught yourself an honest-to-God homicide. Only real homicides aren't like TV. They're not neat like TV. You weren't prepared for it. You blow chunks. That's embarrassing enough, but you do it in front of the woman and me and now you're pissed off. Well, welcome to the real world, kid, only stop behaving like a jerk. You don't touch the suspect. You don't violate her rights like that." <br>The woman was still sitting on the grass, watching us. I don't think she heard a word we said. <br>"She could confess to whacking the guy in there, to killing a hundred more, and most likely you won't be able to touch her because you violated her rights." <br>"Shuddup." <br>"Look, kid, be smart. You can still fix this, you can still make it go away. Start by removing the cuffs. Think about it." <br>He did. For about ten seconds. Then he said, "You're going to jail." <br>Copyright � 2007 by David Housewright.

Follow the tale of one older sibling who learns that having a baby brother or sister can be truly magical - aren&#39;t they lucky!</p><p>Laurence Anholt (Author) Born in 1959 to a Dutch family with Persian roots, Laurence Anholt spent his early years in Holland. He trained as a painter at Falmouth School of Art where he met his wife, the artist, Catherine Anholt. Laurence went on to take a Master&#39;s Degree in Fine Art at the Royal Academy in London. The Anholts have produced more than 200 children&#39;s books, which have been translated into 30 languages. Their titles have won numerous awards including the Nestle Smarties Gold Award on two occasions. Many of their books are written by Laurence and illustrated by Catherine, but Laurence has written for several other artists including Arthur Robins and Tony Ross, and in addition, he self-illustrates his Anholt&#39;s Artists series, an introduction to great art for young children. Random House Penguin will publish Laurence&#39;s first full-length novel, The Hypnotist , in 2016. The Anholts have three grown up children; Claire (30) works for the United Nations in New York, and twins, Tom and Maddy (27) are a Berlin based artist and an actor in London. Catherine and Laurence live in an `upside down&#39; eco-house, surrounded by wildflower meadows overlooking the sea in Devon. Laurence&#39;s passions are family, art, travel, books, Buddhism and bees.Catherine Anholt (Illustrator) Born in 1958 to an Irish family, Catherine was one of eight siblings. &#34;We grew up in a tiny village in the Cotswolds,&#34; she says. &#34;Just a few miles from where Laurie Lee wrote Cider With Rosie. My mother was a nurse and my father was a potter.&#34; It was in this rural setting that Catherine began to work in highly colourful sketchbooks, a habit which continues to the present day. On her degree course at Falmouth School of Art, Catherine met her husband, the artist and writer, Laurence Anholt. Together they moved to London, to take Master&#39;s Degrees at the Royal College of Art and the Royal Academy respectively. Over the next 30 years, the Anholts produced more than 200 children&#39;s books, which have been translated into 30 languages. Their titles have won numerous awards including the Nestle Smarties Gold Award on two occasions. Catherine and Laurence have three grown up children; Claire (30) works for the United Nations in New York and twins, Tom and Maddy (27) are a Berlin based artist, and an actor in London. Catherine and Laurence live in an `upside down&#39; house on top of a hill above the sea in Devon, where they keep bees in their wild and rambling garden. Alongside her picture books, Catherine works daily in her studio, producing hundreds of oil paintings, etchings and drawings, some of which can be seen here: http://www.catherineanholt.comPreSchool-Grade 2-- This book has it all; it's a must for any library serving small children. At first it's "just Mommy and Daddy and me." Then one day the curly haired heroine finds out that a new baby is on the way. After waiting and waiting, she finally gets a baby brother. Everyone who comes to see him says how lucky she is, but this little girl isn't so sure. She has to wait for her mother to play with her; she has to be quiet; she has to be good when what she really wants is to be a baby herself. Finally, a tired mother longs for a big girl to help her. Walks and baths and hugs and laughs follow, and now when people see that big girl with her brother, they say, "Isn't he lucky!" The childlike watercolors with their appealing balloon-faced people have lots of homey details; they convey just the right amount of comfort and warmth. The nine-vignette sequence illustrating the pregnancy is particularly clever, showing the seasons changing and giving a real sense of the passage of time. The simple, clear text touches on all of a young child's joys and concerns during this event. For a photojournalistic approach aimed at slightly older children, consider Kathryn Lasky's A Baby for Max (Scribners, 1984). --Lucy Young Clem, Evansville Vanderburgh County Public Library, IN<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Project Scheduling and Management for Construction</h2><p>Today&#39;s successful project planning, scheduling and management techniques are clearly explained and illustrated in this book.

In 1917, Gabo developed the theories and practice of a new art movement he called Constructivism, and, along with his brother, he wrote the Realistic Manifesto of 1920, which promoted art as a part of man&#x2019;s everyday existence without the confinement of artistic terms and convention. In the 1920s and &#x2019;30s, Gabo traveled extensively to the hubs of modernism in Europe, including a stint teaching at the Bauhaus. He was with Mondrian&#x2019;s Abstraction-Creation group in the wake of the Nazi occupation of Paris, and upon the outbreak of WWII, the artist moved to Cornwall, England, and later to the United States. As this new book&#x2019;s 142 color plates demonstrate, Gabo&#x2019;s work reveals rigorous inquiries into ways of representing mass, volume, and space. His sensitive and imaginative use of materials, ranging from fishing line to Perspex to wood, created a rhythm and balance within his sculptures that evokes an intense emotional response.<p></p></p><p><b>Natalia Sidlina</b> is a researcher at Tate and editor of the online Naum Gabo Archive.<p></p></p><h2>The Big Bounce</h2><p>Together with a tough young drifter named Jack Ryan, hedonistic Nancy Hayes plans her private revenge on a former lover by stealing a fifty-thousand-dollar payroll</p><p>6 1-hour cassettesPLAYMATE OF THE DAY<br><br>Jack Ryan has a man's fists, a boy's mind, and the cunning of an ex-con.

Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for `having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world&#39;. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.

Once there, I screamed, then picked up a dead branch and beat the ground. I wailed and gnashed my teeth, invoking the heavens to bring down some kind of wrath on the bedevilment that was Cleta Sanson.</p><p>And yet I didn&#x2019;t feel one bit better.</p><p>&#x201c;What <i>is</i> your problem, Merry?&#x201d;</p><p>The voice behind me made me jump. I whirled and screamed a more ladylike shriek, but it was just Lizzie with her wispy friend Alcina. The two girls, teens of my acquaintance, were appropriately shod in galoshes. In the spring, even as late as the end of April, the woods are marshy, as I found out a week before by ruining a pair of Cole Haan oxfords. I got stuck in mud while out for what I thought was going to be a stroll, not a three-mile slog through marshy, boggy muck. Thirteen-year-old Alcina had creatively paired her footgear with an old wedding gown and tiara, while frizzy-haired fifteen-year-old Lizzie wore a camo jacket over a sweatshirt and jeans, with her professional-grade DSLR camera slung around her neck.</p><p>Lizzie&#x2019;s attitude was demonstrated by her stance, hands on her hips and thick brows drawn down in defiance. Alcina was her usual elusive self, drifting off to explore, her long, silky blonde hair floating behind her as she moved. Really, the child was positively elfin, and I don&#x2019;t mean that in a bad way. She fascinated me in the same way Shilo, my best female friend, does. Shilo is more dark gypsy, though, than pale elf.</p><p>I stared at Lizzie for a moment, then sighed, deeply. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Miss Sanson.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded in instant understanding. &#x201c;She makes me scream, too, but I don&#x2019;t go out into the woods to do it.&#x201d;</p><p>That explained the echoing shrieks I&#x2019;d been hearing around the castle. I was on the verge of calling in paranormal investigators, but it was good to know the place wasn&#x2019;t haunted. That I knew of, anyway.</p><p>I guess I should explain about the castle. My name is Merry Wynter and I am an almost-forty-year-old widow. Just over a year ago the sudden death of my great-uncle Melvyn Wynter&#x2014;a man I barely remembered meeting once, when I was five&#x2014;left me the family castle near the village of Autumn Vale, New York, a spot about equidistant between Buffalo and Rochester, south of I-90. Wynter Castle is one of those gorgeous monstrosities built by the mill barons of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, in this case my ancestor Jacob Lazarus Wynter, who made his fortune from lumber mills.</p><p>I learned about my inheritance shortly after Melvyn&#x2019;s death. However, I was caught up in a drama between myself and a pill-addicted, mentally unstable model (Leatrice Pugeot, born plain old Lynn Pugmire) for whom I worked as an assistant. She thought I was sabotaging her by baking my fabulous muffins, which she snitched and ate, causing her to gain a few critical ounces. She <i>then</i> accused me of stealing a Tiffany necklace worth tens of thousands. I didn&#x2019;t do that, and still think she either lost it or pawned it.</p><p>She fired me or I quit, depending on who you listened to, and I spent months trying to repair my reputation and find work doing what I once was, a fashion stylist. It finally occurred to me that leaving New York City and letting the dust settle was my best option, so I rented a car and headed to my ancestral home.</p><p>Wynter Castle is beautiful, built of gold limestone that glows in the sunset like a fire has lit it from within. It has Gothic arched windows, mammoth oak double doors, a stained glass rose window, and turret rooms. You&#x2019;d think it would make a good first impression, but when I arrived the property was pocked with holes, the result of someone thinking the place had buried treasure, and we had since seen two murders on the property&#x2014;not the most auspicious of starts.</p><p>But that was last fall and now it was spring, a time of new beginnings. Since then the castle and the people of Autumn Vale had wormed their way into my heart, and I knew it was going to be a wrench to sell and leave, but what choice did I have? It was too expensive to keep, so I was fixing it up room by room to make it saleable.</p><p>None of that explains my screams, or introduces you to Miss Cleta Sanson, the reason for my woodsy wailing, but I&#x2019;m getting there.</p><p>Lizzie was chattering to Alcina about the light filtering through the tree canopy, but I didn&#x2019;t think the other girl was listening. She was crouched over a bug on a dead branch, watching it with fierce intensity. Lizzie took some photos and I wandered farther into the woods, following the ghost of a trail. Becket, the handsome orange cat that I inherited with the castle, had followed me and wound around Lizzie&#x2019;s feet, tripping her up and making her laugh.</p><p>In my head I had been hearing Copland&#x2019;s &#x201c;Appalachian Spring,&#x201d; a soaring American melody that threaded through my mind and haunted me until I came out walking. I was grateful I had heeded the call of the woods. I breathed in deeply, seeking the inner peace I had surprisingly begun to find in the great outdoors since moving to Wynter Castle, even though I am a city girl born and bred. The forest was coming alive with brilliant green shoots poking up through the blanket of dead leaves and trees were showing a shimmering burst of radiant green. I shivered as a chill wind sprang up, making the budding leaves on the trees tremble. My feet squished into the bog. It was still too wet to do much outside and I was about to turn around and head home when I spotted some kind of structure ahead, through the brush.</p><p>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; I asked Lizzie, pointing through the trees. Since she and Alcina spent a lot of time in the woods messing around and constructing Alcina&#x2019;s fairy rings and gnome homes I thought she might know.</p><p>She squinted, sweeping back a mass of her frizzy hair. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;ve never been this far into these woods.&#x201d; She lifted her camera and took some shots, then peered at the camera screen, doing something to make it show a close-up. The kid was a whiz with the camera.</p><p>I looked over her shoulder at what appeared to be a tower of sorts. Intrigued, I headed toward it, the teens following. It was slow going, since I had to climb over mossy fallen logs and push through the occasional tangle of brush, but we reached a more open area and found the object I had spied.</p><p>It was a lopsided medieval-looking structure built of cobblestones with a conical roof of cedar shakes. It looked like something out of a fairy tale but on a minor scale, kind of a Rapunzel tower but only ten or twelve feet tall. And it wasn&#x2019;t alone. To the left of it, a little farther down a path layered in pine needles and littered with dead branches, was a shed-size structure that, though worn by years of rain and neglect, was clearly meant to be a little gingerbread house. There were candy cane eaves in faded, peeling red and white, and the slab doors looked like they had been painted to resemble graham cracker wafers. Hansel and Gretel sprang to mind. Beyond the tower to the right was a little house that appeared to be set into the side of the hill, like a gnome home! Becket rushed up the hillock and hung over the edge, like a tiny marmalade tiger awaiting prey.</p><p>Faintly, I said, &#x201c;Lizzie, can you take pictures of all of this for me?&#x201d;</p><p>She was already snapping and ignored me completely, caught up in her passion, photography. I like the kid a lot. Lizzie is stubborn, occasionally rude, irascible, and funny. Her pithy observations on life are sometimes hilarious, and often uncomfortably truthful.</p><p>I turned around slowly, spying more buildings through the woods. My uncle&#x2014;every time I thought I&#x2019;d gotten to the end of his wonderful weirdness I found something new. This had his crafty but incapable fingerprints all over it. Maybe I had stumbled across one of his mad never-quite-successful schemes to make Wynter Castle pay, a fairy-tale park of some sort?</p><p>It was too much to take in and I knew I&#x2019;d have to leave it alone, since I had a full, busy day ahead of me yet. As the peace of the forest seeped into me I took a deep breath and accepted the dreadful truth. I had to return to the castle and face the Legion of Horrible Ladies. I called out to Lizzie, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be too long! You&#x2019;re supposed to help pour tea this afternoon, and I want you halfway respectable looking.&#x201d; I then trudged back alone, leaving Becket, Lizzie, and Alcina to explore and take photos. Robert Frost would have loved my forests. The woods were lovely, dark, and deep, but I had promises to keep.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve mentioned the Legion of Horrible Ladies, but how to explain them? It all started with Pish, one of my two best friends and my financial mentor, who had an idea that would make me enough money to stay in the castle long enough to fix it up. Shilo Dinnegan, my other best friend&#x2014;both Pish and Shilo had followed me to Wynter Castle and stayed&#x2014;had married local real estate agent Jack McGill just four months after meeting him. At Shilo&#x2019;s December wedding Pish suggested that since I needed money in order to live in Wynter Castle long enough to complete the renovations, I should invite select folks to come rent rooms, wealthy people who would pay handsomely to stay in an honest-to-goodness castle.</p><p>He knew one such person, his darling, dotty aunt Lush. She had been pining over Wynter Castle ever since Pish took some photos home on one of his monthly visits to his mother. Lush would pay a generous fee to temporarily call Wynter Castle home, and might even know another select wealthy widow or two who would do the same. I said yes. Between that and the money from a film company who used Wynter Castle for some external shots, I could afford to stay and fix the place up, making it more attractive to a future buyer.</p><p>So Pish&#x2019;s dotty aunt had come to stay and she was a chubby, cheerful, sweet-natured doll. She told the best stories, and we had a lovely month with her alone. She went back to the city for a doctor&#x2019;s appointment, and I told her, <i>If you have a friend who would like to rent a room, let me know.</i></p><p>Two weeks later she came back with four friends in tow: her bridge club, who she had been meeting every week for cards for fifty years or more. They <i>all</i> wanted to stay, she said with a charming twinkle, as they milled about the great hall critiquing the d�cor and asking when dinner was served. I wanted to throttle her.</p><p>My first panicked thought was to put them up for the night and send them packing back to the city, but it rapidly became clear that it was not so simple. One had actually sublet her apartment on the strength of Lush&#x2019;s swooning appraisal of the castle, so she had nowhere to go for six months! Also, my greedy brain had begun to tote up the rent I could command, and it was staggering. It was going to be a lot more work, but maybe it would be worth it. I can stand anything for a few months, I thought.</p><p>As often happens, I was wrong. I was slowly going mad from the awfulness of their combined force: the bickering and demands, the whining and quarrels, the endless sheer bloody-mindedness of a couple of them, in particular Cleta Sanson, the Queen B&#x2014;<i>B</i> standing for <i>witch</i> with a <i>b</i>&#x2014;of the Legion of Horrible Ladies, as I had come to call them after one particularly bad day.</p><p>To keep them busy I had, with Gogi Grace, the owner and operator of the local home for the elderly and my new friend, planned a series of luncheon and afternoon events. Some days we would have lunch, and other days we would offer afternoon tea&#x2014;cookies, muffins, and cards in the elegant castle dining room with some of Gogi&#x2019;s selected residents&#x2014;all designed to keep the Legion ladies busy and interested. The first one, a couple of weeks before, was a disaster. Today we were attempting a second, hopefully better-planned event, a musical afternoon, which was why I had to hustle back to the castle.</p><p>I entered through the butler&#x2019;s pantry door, which opened on a long hallway holding the only ground-floor bathroom, a series of storage cabinets, and a wet sink area once used by an actual butler. I strolled into my kitchen. It is enormous, long and fairly wide, with a sitting area at the far end that has a huge hearth topped by a sturdy mantel, and some wing chairs pulled up to it. The working heart of the impressive commercial kitchen was immediately before me. My uncle had poured a lot of money and effort into the space during what seemed to have been a rare moment of clarity. It is perfectly suited to be the kitchen for an inn or small hotel, with two stainless steel deep sinks and countertops on either side, a six-burner stove, and a commercial refrigerator. Centered in the room is a long worktable that I use as a breakfast bar and prep area.</p><p>Emerald, who now worked for me looking after the Legion and cooking, among other things, turned away from her task of polishing silver at the long table, and smiled. &#x201c;You look exhausted and we haven&#x2019;t even started,&#x201d; she commented, blowing some of her brown bangs out of her eyes and giving a toss to her ponytail.</p><p>I smiled back. From a hard-ass cocktail waitress Emerald had transformed into a neat and efficient jill-of-all-trades, adept at cooking, cleaning, and even the odd turn at fixing small appliances and installing safety bars in the upstairs washrooms. At first I hadn&#x2019;t been sure of how she was going to fare at the castle, but she joined some kind of group, Consciousness Calling, and since then had become much more focused and diligent. I wasn&#x2019;t quite sure what the group was all about, but she went there several times a week, studying acupressure or some such deal that she said would lead to a career helping people. I told her about meeting Lizzie and Alcina in the woods.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope Lizzie doesn&#x2019;t lose track and gets back here in time to help,&#x201d; she said, continuing her polishing. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to do with her sometimes. She gets in a funk and it&#x2019;s hard to pry her out of it. I feel like I&#x2019;ve let her down so many times.&#x201d;</p><p>Juniper Jones, my most recent acquisition as live-in employee, was in the kitchen, too, morosely scouring the sink, almost disappearing in the deep stainless well, the smell of cleanser drifting up and through the kitchen. I knew Juniper&#x2019;s routine enough to know that once she had scrubbed completely and rinsed, she would bleach the crap out of it. Her fondness for chemical cleaners was a little alarming, but her hard work made it worth putting up with it.</p><p>&#x201c;Em, you had a lot on your plate,&#x201d; I said, referring obliquely to her fight with her mother over where Lizzie was living, and her evening job at the bar in Ridley Ridge&#x2014;both now things of the past&#x2014;and the murder of Lizzie&#x2019;s father, Tom Turner, whose body I discovered on my own property as he tore up the land looking for the mythical Wynter fortune. I had been wary of Emerald at first because she came off as a tough chickie, and I&#x2019;ve never been quite sure how to deal with women like that. But her new life, Consciousness Calling, her friendship with the late Tom Turner&#x2019;s half sister, Binny, and Tom&#x2019;s dad, Rusty, and a better relationship with her daughter had softened her.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting better,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Having stuff to do is good for both of us. ...</p></p><h2>Murder on Ice</h2><p>When the judge who cast the deciding vote that gave the gold to a Russian skater instead of America&#39;s sweetheart is found brutally murdered, Rebecca &#34;Bex&#34; Levy, figure-skating researcher for the 24/7 network, must glide carefully as she investigates this baffling mystery.

Taylor (English/Bethel College; Letters to My Children, not reviewed) believes that stories make it possible for us to be human; they ``tell us who we are, why we are here, and what we are doing.'' We learn them as family stories and as school and religious lessons; strangers surround us with their stories on television, in movies, and in books and magazines; and we tell our own stories about ourselves. They preserve our memories, explain our present, and help us imagine our future. With tales such as Huckleberry Finn, Taylor illustrates how exposure to characters in stories helps to mold one's own character, and using Elie Wiesel's memoir Night, he demonstrates how stories shape one's view of the world. They teach us that character is more important than personality, and they challenge us to be characters engaged in life, not simply passive spectators. The values of every human society are captured in its stories, says Taylor, and to be civilized is to internalize those values; thus we are defined by our stories and by the stories we choose to tell our children. The healing power of stories, he says, comes from their power to reconnect us with others, for a story implies a community of at least two, a teller and a listener, each with responsibilities to the other. An appendix includes questions about readers' own stories; in answering the questions, says Taylor, readers will find better understanding not only of the stories but of themselves. Makes a trip to the library seem more rewarding than a session with one's therapist. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He won the 2004 Caldecott Medal for <em>The Man Who Walked Between the Towers</em> and is also a painter, sculptor, and prizewinning designer and director of animated films. Mordicai Gerstein lives in western Massachusetts with his wife, Susan Yard Harris, who is also an illustrator, and their daughter, Risa. </p>Grade 2 Up This story of the death and reincarnation of a Tibetan woodcutter is a beautifully gentle look at one human being dealing with life's choices and possibilities. As a boy, he thought about other worlds that he would someday visit; as a man, he thought of other countries and people, yet ``he was always busy with his work and his wife and children.'' After his death, he is given the option of being part of ``the endless universe some call heaven'' or living another life, and he chooses another life. The choices which follow take him through all the galaxies, stars, planets, creatures, peoples, countries, and parents before arriving at the final twist in this journey back to where he had beenalmost. Thus, the story comes full circle. The quiet, rhythmic text is in perfect unity with the softly colored but radiant watercolor and gouache illustrations, leaving readers with a sense of wholeness and resolution. The golden borders neatly tuck the story in and add to its feeling of satisfaction and quiet joy. The real world scenes are in neatly boxed frames while the worlds of possibilities are displayed in mandala-like circular drawings. The main character, pictured in his small personal mandala, shows a range of emotions and dance-like movement. The kites held by the children in three scenes connect the multiple worlds of the story, providing both a grounding in the world we know and a means to soar beyond it. Children will appreciate the well-told tale and the joyous satisfaction of being one's own self in a large and magical world. Kay E.

The power of these meditations is that they reflect the author&#x2019;s personal spiritual journey into the depths of God&#x2019;s kingdom within &#x2014; within the soul, within personal relationships, within nature, and within the cosmos. <p>Part one describes an encounter with the Father through the miracles of the Creation, the Fall, and, through Moses&#x2019; acceptance of the Covenant of the Old Testament, the Ten Commandments. </p><p>Part two is a meditation on the seven miracles of Christ in the Gospel of St. John. It culminates in the raising of Lazarus; the miracle of being raised from forgetfulness; sleep and death to remembrance, wakefulness, and resurrection. In this way, Lazarus becomes a paradigm for understanding the spiritual and cultural history of humanity. </p><p>Part three considers the encounter with the Holy Spirit and living out Christ&#x2019;s life through the Church. We are asked to reflect on the three Kingdoms of God, humankind, and nature, which give natural order and meaning to the Christian life. The union of love and prayer in the Spirit is the focus of an epilogue, in which we are invited to see our natural breathing as breathing the breath of God.</p></p><p>Valentin Tomberg (1900-1975) was born in St. Petersberg, Russia. Born into a Lutheran family, he entered the Russian Christian esoteric tradition at an early age, having been strongly influenced by Vladimir Soloviev and by a personal experience of the Sophia at a cathedral in Holland. Under the auspices of the Anthroposophical Society, he became a much loved lecturer in Holland and England. Because of conflicts within the society after Steiner&#39;s death in 1925, Tomberg eventually determined to enter the Catholic Church. Since then, he has been one of the most controversial figures within the anthroposophic movement. His conversion is often attacked, and the mere mention of his works can provoke alarm. During the latter part of his life, he resided in England, working for the BBC and devoting his time to meditation and writing.

In <i>Captain Rock</i>, James S. Donnelly, Jr., offers both a fine-grained analysis of the conflict and a broad exploration of Irish rural society after the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Originating in west Limerick, the Rockite movement spread quickly under the impact of a prolonged economic depression. Before long the insurgency embraced many of the better-off farmers. The intensity of the Rockites&#x2019; grievances, the frequency of their resort to sensational violence, and their appeal on such key issues as rents and tithes presented a nightmarish challenge to Dublin Castle&#x2014;prompting in turn a major reorganization of the police, a purging of the local magistracy, the introduction of large military reinforcements, and a determined campaign of judicial repression. A great upsurge in sectarianism and millenarianism, Donnelly shows, added fuel to the conflagration. Inspired by prophecies of doom for the Anglo-Irish Protestants who ruled the country, the overwhelmingly Catholic Rockites strove to hasten the demise of the landed elite they viewed as oppressors.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Drawing on a wealth of sources&#x2014;including reports from policemen, military officers, magistrates, and landowners as well as from newspapers, pamphlets, parliamentary inquiries, depositions, rebel proclamations, and threatening missives sent by Rockites to their enemies&#x2014;<i>Captain Rock</i> offers a detailed anatomy of a dangerous, widespread insurgency whose distinctive political contours will force historians to expand their notions of how agrarian militancy influenced Irish nationalism in the years before the Great Famine of 1845&#x2013;51.</p><p>James S.

Besides its presentation of the subject and sterling analysis three things merit note. One is the author's introduction to the work, an introduction which admirably serves to prepare the reader and promises where the reader where the story is going to go. The second is to say that this is a book well suited to use in courses in modem Irish history. The final note is topraise the book's use of numerous illustrations. Not only are these illuminating but they bear truly useful captions. In a time when Irish history is actively exploring the visual evidence of the past, one could only wish that more publishers would use these types of sources in this way. The illustrations make clear, in the same way Jim Donnelly has in his exploration of this subject, just how important all those rebels were helping to forge the politics of an emerging nation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sean Farrell Moran, <i>Irish Literary Supplement</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Donnelly&#x2019;s <i>Captain Rock</i> is, in short, a substantial achievement.

Tour.</p><p><b>Lou Cannon</b>, a longtime political reporter and White House correspondent for The Washington Post, was the paper's Los Angeles bureau chief from 1977 to 1980 and again from 1991 to 1993. He is currently a special correspondent for The Post in the West.This reporter's ambitious reconstruction of the Rodney King case presents a sobering image, not just of Los Angeles, but of judicial mayhem and political exploitation. Cannon (President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime, 1991, etc.) was L.A. bureau chief of the Washington Post from 1990 to 1993. He repeatedly says that the beating of Rodney King was a Rashomon-like event in which every observer came away with a different perception of even the bare facts. Cannon's chronicle of the legal and political saga--from the night of the beating through the trial of the rioters who attacked Reginald Denny--is almost entirely drawn from the point of view of police officers. Within this particular framework, it is certainly authoritative, though the reader will almost always be nagged by a feeling of not having the whole story. He does show that the King incident was not representative of what it's like to be a suspect in the hands of the LAPD, and that only because it was videotaped did the world take it to be so. Cannon's masterful narrative, with tight control over its vast scope and incredible detail, overflows his own restriced frame, allowing readers copious material with which to weigh his implicit conviction regarding the innocence of the officers of the charges brought against them, and the LAPD's (and the judicial system's) broader guilt- -the ``negligence'' of the title (such as lack of training of police officers in the proper use of the baton to subdue a suspect). He creates an often complicated but always crystal-clear chronicle, seeming to recount years of turmoil almost minute-by-minute. Along with the major players, every juror and witness is introduced with extensive biographical background. Seemingly small legal issues and lawyerly subtexts of the trials are zealously pursued; by the time Cannon gets to the Denny trial, readers may be exhausted, but they will have achieved some clarity. As indispensable as it is incomplete. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Countless others worship Rama as an avatar, a human incarnation of Lord Vishnu born to vanquish the forces of evil and establish a kingdom of perfect justice and harmony upon the earth. The Ramayana, one of lndia's greatest epics, lovingly unfolds the story of Rama's life. Ever since its original composition in Sanskrit by Vaimiki, possibly over 3,000 years ago, it has grown to be an all-pervasive and hugely-loved part of Indian life and ethos. Millions read it, re-read it, and revere it as a scripture. It is the perennially favourite bedtime story for children. And each autumn, Rama's victory over the mighty demon-king Ravana is celebrated through plays and dance-dramas in cities, towns and villages across the land. There is much festivity: crackers are exploded, sweets distributed and all houses are lit up in tribute to Rama. <br><br> R.K. Narayan's Ramayana is inspired by a Tamil-version of the epic written by an eleventh century poet, Kamban. It offers the reader a compact yet unhurried retelling of this great epic, and succeeds marvellously in evoking its literary lustre which has shone undimmed through the centuries.</p><p>C.

A buffoon burdened with a brimming heart, Harlequin chases his sensible, oblivious Columbine around the city streets, having given his heart freely. Consumed with love, the impulsive clown sees his heart dragged about town, with a charming surprise to bend the tale in a modern direction. Gaiman&#39;s writing is poetic and as heartfelt as the subject matter. Bolton&#39;s art, a combination of digitally enhanced photorealism and dynamic painting, provides sensational depth with bright characters over fittingly muted backgrounds. Those who have spent Valentine&#39;s Day alone are aware that the cold February holiday can be hard to swallow. Gaiman and Bolton want you to know that all it takes is a steak knife, a fork, and a bottle of quality ketchup!</p><p>Neil Gaiman is an acclaimed novelist and writer of comics, short stories, screen and teleplays. He wrote all 75 issues of DC&#39;s groundbreaking Sandman series, an epic meditation on myths and storytelling. His other comics work includes Books of Magic, Death, Signal to Noise, and Mr. Punch. He created the BBC&#39;s hit television series Neverwhere, soon to be a major motion picture. With the publication of the best-selling Neverwhere novel, Gaiman made the leap from graphic visionary to literary novelist. His other books include Smoke and Mirrors, Stardust, and Good Omens with Terry Pratchett. In 1999, he wrote the English-language script for the anime blockbuster Princess Mononoke and returned to Sandman with the new graphic novel The Dreamhunters. He received the 1997 Defender of Liberty Award from the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund for his constant support of free expression in comics. The Dictionary of Literary Biography lists him along with Thomas Pynchon and William S. Burroughs as one of America&#39;s &#34;top ten post-modern writers.&#34; Gaiman welcomed Spring, 2001 with the much heralded release of his XXth novel, American Gods.<b>Neil Gaiman </b>was born in Hampshire, UK, and now lives in the United States near Minneapolis. As a child he discovered his love of books, reading, and stories, devouring the works of C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, James Branch Cabell, Edgar Allan Poe, Michael Moorcock, Ursula K. Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, and G. K. Chesterton. A self-described "feral child who was raised in libraries," Gaiman credits librarians with fostering a lifelong love of reading: "I wouldn't be who I am without libraries. I was the sort of kid who devoured books, and my happiest times as a boy were when I persuaded my parents to drop me off in the local library on their way to work, and I spent the day there. I discovered that librarians actually want to help you: They taught me about interlibrary loans."<br><br>Neil Gaiman's work has been honored with many awards internationally, including the Newbery and Carnegie Medals. His books and stories have also been honored with four Hugos, two Nebulas, one World Fantasy Award, four Bram Stoker Awards, six Locus Awards, two British Science Fiction Association Awards, one British Fantasy Award, three Geffens, one International Horror Guild Award, and two Mythopoeic Awards.<br><br><b>John Bolton </b>is a comic book artist, penciller, and cover artist known for <i>Aliens vs. Predator, Ghost</i>,<i> The Chronicles of Kull</i>,<i> Savage Sword</i>, and <i>Someplace Strange.&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Ernest Hemingway: A Literary Reference</h2><p>He fished the deep sea off the coast of Cuba, he hunted big game in Africa and Idaho, he ran with the bulls in Pamplona, he reported on the civil war in Spain and World War II in Europe. He was a dynamic, handsome man. He hobnobbed with movie stars like Marlene Dietrich, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper, and Ava Gardner. He brawled, he drank, he womanized. For four decades he also wrote some of the most popular and critically successful novels in modern American literature, from The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms in the 1920s to the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning The Old Man and the Sea in 1952. In 1954 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. And his suicide in 1961 made international front-page news, for by then the world adventurer Ernest Hemingway had become the most famous American author of the twentieth century. Warfare, boxing, bullfights, fishing, art, good food, bad men, unhappy relationships, love&#x2014;you can find the man&#x2019;s interests everywhere reflected in his work. Yet ultimately nothing mattered more to Hemingway than the work, which this volume both celebrates and documents with photographs and a fascinating assortment of excerpts from letters, interviews, news reports, essays, speeches, book reviews, and manuscripts. Facsimiles of Hemingway&#x2019;s works in progress demonstrate how he worked, while reprints of his commentary on his own fiction as well as that of other writers further illuminate the mind and methods that produced such modern classics as For Whom the Bell Tolls and Men Without Women. Generously illustrated and meticulously compiled, this volume of literary biography offers a wide variety of resources by which to view anew Hemingway&#x2019;s life and work.</p><p></p><h2>The Man Who Knew Too Much: Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer</h2><p><p><strong>A "skillful and literate" (<em>New York Times Book Review</em>) biography of the persecuted genius who helped create the modern computer.</strong></p> To solve one of the great mathematical problems of his day, Alan Turing proposed an imaginary computer. Then, attempting to break a Nazi code during World War II, he successfully designed and built one, thus ensuring the Allied victory. Turing became a champion of artificial intelligence, but his work was cut short. As an openly gay man at a time when homosexuality was illegal in England, he was convicted and forced to undergo a humiliating "treatment" that may have led to his suicide.<br><br> With a novelist's sensitivity, David Leavitt portrays Turing in all his humanity&#x2015;his eccentricities, his brilliance, his fatal candor&#x2015;and elegantly explains his work and its implications.</p><p>David Leavitt is the author of novels including The Body of Jonah Boyd and The Two Hotel Francforts, as well as story collections. The New York Public Library honored him as a Literary Lion. He teaches creative writing at the University of Florida, Gainesville, where he lives.Twenty-five years ago the word "Turing" tingled with mystery for the few who knew it. Readers of Douglas Hofstadter learned that Alan Turing belonged with G�del in exploring minds and logic and knew also of "the Turing test" for artificial intelligence. But others were aware of Turing as a British figure, a Cambridge mathematician, emerging in connection with the huge World War II operation to break the Enigma ciphers. His crucial importance in the battle of the Atlantic was still shrouded by state secrecy. In fact, it was only after this secrecy was lifted that he began to be acknowledged for another great contribution&#x2014;his role in the origin of the computer. The conspicuously missing feature was the testimony of Alan Turing himself. He had died at age 41 in 1954, apparently killing himself with cyanide&#x2014; and leaving a jagged hole in history. By 1980 rumor told of the prosecution and punishment that he had undergone as a homosexual in 1952. But even then, such a story could no longer serve as a simple explanation of suicide. Turing&#x2019;s friends had known him as unashamed and contemptuous of convention. A different suspicion struck those who knew the dark side of the 1950s. The victorious Allies must have been appalled by this revelation of the man who knew their secrets: How could Turing&#x2019;s private desires be reconciled with the public demands of state security? But on this question, total silence reigned. Since then, the situation has completely changed. A number of events have made Turing&#x2019;s life better known to the public than that of probably any other mathematician. A notable actor, Derek Jacobi, has played Turing&#x2019;s drama to millions of viewers in Hugh Whitemore&#x2019;s 1986 play Breaking the Code. Little is secret from Google, and computer science students may find themselves expected to assess his life and death. Massive U.S. government releases in the 1990s have made World War II code breaking the subject of detailed scholarship, and conferences and books celebrate Turing&#x2019;s continuing influence. Complexity theory and quantum computing build on his analysis of computation, and since the 1980s Roger Penrose has given new life to Turing&#x2019;s deepest questions. Above all, Turing&#x2019;s reputation is now solidly underpinned by the vindication of his vision. Although John von Neumann led by a few months in creating a computer plan, it was Turing who explained in 1946 how "every known process" could be turned into computer software. Turing had seen this prospect in the simple but revolutionary principle of his Universal Turing Machine, laid out in a paper in 1936, and had thus created an amazing link between the purest mathematics and the most productive industrial applications. But there are always more secrets to unravel and always room for yet another introduction. A series of "great discoveries," such as the current undertaking from W. W. Norton, cannot ignore Turing, and it is interesting to see the story of his contributions attempted by an American novelist, David Leavitt. The story is not simply a question of dates and facts. To use one of Turing&#x2019;s own images, it is like the skin of an onion. It calls for a writer who can unpeel it with care and who is unafraid of tears. Intensely private, yet relishing popular writing and broadcasts, fiercely proud and yet absurdly self-effacing, Turing led a strange life intertwined with characteristically odd British puzzles of class and lifestyle. A central paradox is that he asserted the "heretical theory" that the human mind could be rivaled by a computer, whereas his own personality so little resembled the output of a machine. It was willful, individualistic, unpredictable. His struggle to incorporate initiative and creativity in his artificial-intelligence theory is therefore a personal drama. This is a puzzle that goes to the heart of science and yet is also fine material for a novelist of insight. Leavitt&#x2019;s focus is elsewhere, however. It is on Turing as the gay outsider, driven to his death. No opportunity is lost to highlight this subtext. When Turing quips about the principle of "fair play for machines," Leavitt sees a plea for homosexual equality. It is quite right to convey his profound alienation and to bring out the consistency of his English liberalism. It is valuable to show human diversity lying at the center of scientific inquiry. But Leavitt&#x2019;s laborious decoding understates the constant dialogue between subjective individual vision and the collective work of mathematics and science, with its ideal of objectivity, to which Turing gave his life. Scientific content is not neglected; Leavitt&#x2019;s discussion of Turing&#x2019;s 1936 paper has perhaps excessive technical detail. But the vision is partial: he fails to give any discussion of what Turing&#x2019;s proof implies for the question of artificial intelligence. A general problem is that, being the prisoner of secondary sources, the author finds himself the outsider. He quotes from another writer on statistical methods in 19th-century code breaking but omits the primary fact that Turing&#x2019;s central scientific contribution at Bletchley Park, the British wartime cryptanalytic center, was his statistical theory of weighing evidence. The book&#x2019;s subtitle is "Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer," but on the critical question of Turing&#x2019;s relationship with von Neumann it must rely on quoting Martin Davis&#x2019;s Engines of Logic. This is no groundbreaking book, nor does it do much hoeing or weeding. It is a survey of a field long cultivated by other hands, devoid of new witnesses. The title, also secondhand, suggests new light on his death, but there are no new facts. Leavitt claims a "sad descent into grief and madness" induced by the prosecution&#x2014;he ignores the heap of manuscripts from Turing&#x2019;s last prolific year of research and misrepresents his renewed interest in physics as ravings. No new revelation about Turing&#x2019;s code breaking is offered. Leavitt describes his visit to Bletchley Park&#x2014;now a museum&#x2014;but only as a tourist, to report the embarrassment of a tour guide in describing Turing&#x2019;s fate. In this book, Leavitt offers his own tour. It is one that many will find congenial and that will at least introduce new readers to the still tingling enigma of Alan Turing. <p><i>Andrew Hodges, a mathematician at the University of Oxford, is author of Alan Turing: The Enigma (1983).</i></p></p><h2>Wildcats Slam Dunk (Team Jake Maddox Sports Stories)</h2><p>It takes each player on the Wildcats basketball team to win.

Physician-assisted suicide. Same-sex marriages. Embryonic stem-cell research. Poverty. Crime. What is a faithful Christian response? The God of the Bible is unquestionably a God of justice. Yet Christians have had their differences as to how human government and the church should bring about a just social order. Although Christians share many deep and significant theological convictions, differences that threaten to divide them have often surrounded the matter of how the church collectively and Christians individually ought to engage the public square. What is the mission of the church? What is the purpose of human government? How ought they to be related to each other? How should social injustice be redressed? The five noted contributors to this volume answer these questions from within their distinctive Christian theological traditions, as well as responding to the other four positions. Through the presentations and ensuing dialogue we come to see more clearly what the differences are, where their positions overlap and why they diverge.

In the six years 1962-1968 between drawing board and first flight, a myriad of challenges were overcome related to weight, reliability and safety. The final design, designated the Lunar Module or "LM", boasted tiny windows instead of large portholes, four legs instead of five and most famously had no seats &#x2015; instead relying on the astronauts' legs to cushion a lunar landing. Ten LMs made it into space including three flown in development and test missions, and six which landed on the Moon. A seventh famously saved the crew of Apollo 13 when that mission's Command Module suffered a catastrophic malfunction. Originally created for NASA by Grumman in 1964, this LEM Familiarization Manual provides an operational description of all subsystems and major components of the lunar lander. It includes sections about the LEM mission, spacecraft structure, operational subsystems, prelaunch operations, and ground support equipment.</p><p></p><h2>The Truman era,</h2><p>The Truman Era</p><p></p><h2>The Secret Garden</h2><p>Illus. in full color.

The greatest author of fantastic fiction in the Polish language is Stefan Grabinski (1877-1936), the master of the short story form. Grabinski&#39;s stories, which he termed psychofantasies, are explorations of the extreme in human behaviour, where the macabre and the bizarre combine to send a chill down the reader&#39;s spine. When it comes to the erotic, few authors can match Grabinski&#39;s depiction of seething sexual frenzy.</p><p>Stefan Grabinski (1887-1936) is considered Poland's greatest writer of fantastic fiction. He suffered from tuberculosis of the bone and his sickly nature, coupled with an introspective disposition, led to him to write. He published his first collection of stories, On the Hill of Roses in 1918, followed by The Motion Demon in 1919 and The Book of Fire in 1922. <p>Miroslaw Lipinski is a writer and translator. He is of Polish descent and lives in New York. </p><p>Madeleine Johnson Madeleine Johnson after a career in bookselling works in publishing as an editor.</p>'Grabinski's commitment to a marriage of the newly announced unconscious with the supernatural gives his extravagances some conviction. These short stories offer the pleasure of myths we can crack and skilfully chilling denouements.'<br>David Buckley in The Observer<br><br>'Psycho-fantasies, doom-saturated tales of lonely men lost in hostile terrain, but the melancholy lifts to provide wonderful odd scenes, like the watchmaker whose death stops all the town clocks and the phantom train that always turns up unannounced, surprising the station staff'<br>Time Out<br><br>'Stories that brilliantly convey his love of supernatural horror.

In her previous novel, <i>Empress Orchid</i>, Anchee Min covered the first part of the life of Tzu Hsi, or Empress Orchid. Now, in <i>The Last Empress</i>, the empress is a widow, mother of the only male heir of the now-deceased emperor, and in a formidable position. Still, she must contend with palace intrigue on all fronts; even her eunuchs are bribed. She must put up with the smiling faces of men and women who mean her great harm, and, worst of all, her son takes up with prostitutes and dies of veneral disease. She adopts her nephew to be emperor, treats him like a son, and despairs of his weakness. Constant deceit is not the only difficulty which must be faced: incursions of foreigners and domestic rebellion are also part of this violent period at the end of the 19th century. There is the love-hate relationship with the Japanese, the Boxer Rebellion, and widespread mistrust of Western foreigners. Yet Empress Orchid believes that they must appease these factions in order to preserve the dynasty and the throne. All these problems converge to bring the Ch'ing Dynasty to its eventual demise. <p> A disclaimer: do not read <i>The Last Empress</i> as straight historical fact. Anchee Min makes no bones about the fact that her writing is meant to "rehabilitate" crucial female figures in Chinese history. Whichever account of Tzu Hsi is correct, the historical tradition that she was an overbearing harridan, selfish, greedy, and bloodthirsty or Min's portrayal of her as a loving mother, trying to protect her country and longing to step down but prevented from doing so by her wishy-washy son, <i>The Last Empress</i> is an endlessly interesting look at palace life, that hermetically sealed world that once existed in China. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Anchee Min was born in Shanghai in 1957. At seventeen she was sent to a labor collective, where a talent scout for Madame Mao&#x2019;s Shanghai Film Studio recruited her to work as a movie actress. She came to the United States in 1984 with the help of actress Joan Chen. Her memoir, Red Azalea, was named one of the New York Times Notable Books of 1994 and was an international bestseller, with rights sold in twenty countries. Her novels Becoming Madame Mao and Empress Orchid were published to critical acclaim and were national bestsellers. Her two other novels, Katherine and Wild Ginger, were published to wonderful reviews and impressive foreign sales.</p><h2>Short Stories German 1.1 Reader</h2><p>SHORT STORIES GERMAN 1.1 READER contains 34 original short stories.

An introduction to the book and thumbnail biographies of the contributors help guide the readers who are discovering these writers for the first time. There are selections from Di Klasikers &#x2014; the three classic figures who revitalized the language, invented new genres, and made its literature a driving force in the life of a tightly bound community. Mendele Mocher Sforim is known as the grandfather, I. L. Peretz the father, and Sholom Aleichem the son. Contemporary audiences will know of Aleichem as the author of the tales that inspired <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>. Next come selections from Sholom An-ski, best known to American audiences as author of the haunting play the &#x201c;Dybbuk.&#x201d; Weinstein introduces a trio of Yiddish poets &#x2014; sweatshop poet Morris Rosenfeld, modernist Yankev Glatshteyn, and the Partisan Poet, Abraham Sutzkever &#x2014; and concludes with a selection of Yiddish folk songs.</p><p>MIRIAM WEINSTEIN is the author of <i>Yiddish: A Nation of Words</i> (Steerforth 2001, Ballantine 2002). A freelance journalist whose features have won several awards from the New England Press Association, Weinstein grew up in the Bronx following World War II, a time and place where Yiddish was standard fare. She now lives in Manchester, Massachusetts with her husband, and has two grown children.Though small, this collection of stories and verse contains the essence of Yiddish literature. Edited and introduced with a sure hand by Weinstein (Yiddish: A Nation of Words), the selections range from Yitzhak Leib Peretz's "Three Gifts," which shows extraordinary insight into the Jewish soul, to Shimon An-ski's wonderful "Mendle Turk" and Isaac Bashevis Singer's "The Bus," a tour de force of love, lust, and mystic adventure in the guise of the mundane. Ghetto poet Morris Rosenfeld, modernist Yankev Glatshteyn, and World War II partisan Abraham Sutzkever represent Yiddish poetry, and a group of Yiddish folk songs is included as well. The collection ends with Hirsh Gilke's "We Are Here"-known also as the "Song of the Partisans," a fitting end to this excellent volume.

In this letter Paul more than once fiercely counters the attacks of his opponents. He extensively describes both the quality and circumstances of his apostolic existence: the sufferings he endures, the opposition he encounters, and his continual care for the Churches. Second Corinthians is, therefore, highly significant theologically as well as autobiographically.</p><p>Not an easy letter to follow, the emotional language used in 2 Corinthians, the question of the integrity of 2 Corinthians as a letter, and inadequate information about the concrete situation at Corinth and the identity of Paul's opponents make following the flow of Paul's argument difficult at times.

She lives in Los Angeles.This anthology features [edited] transcripts of conversations between art writer Isenberg (Making It Big, LJ 3/15/97) and 54 current or former West Coast artists, writers, actors, and composers in which they express their views of California and its affects on their lives and work. The commonality of living or having lived in the Golden State and the book's sheer number of interviews contribute to a more general, and perhaps unexpected, cumulative message: a defensive championing of the state's freer creative climate. Repeatedly, artists describe how the cultural and historical setting has permitted more experimentation than would be possible in New York. The whiff of regionalism here is not helped by the book's narrow Southern California bias, likely the result of Isenberg's L.A. Times reporter background. (Only a quarter of the artists come from north of Tehachapi.) The collection is saved by the interesting and eclectic variety of means with which these people have found their creative niches, as when Dave Brubeck explains the impact on his musical ear of the rhythms he heard (of horses, pumps) during his ranchland childhood. Although it fails to transcend its limitations, this is an illuminating book, best suited for West Coast and large art libraries.DDouglas F.

Her affection for knitting started at a young age when she was taught to knit by her grandmother. At university Jem studied Fine Art focussing on sculpture and installation.

Today, Jem works as a freelance knitting pattern designer and consultant for Rowan Yarns, having previously worked closely with Coats Crafts as Territory Manager. She lives in Nottingham and is dedicated to passing on knitting skills through inspiring workshops and design.This is a sweet collection of 14 projects for a nursery. Mum and baby would both be thrilled with any of the projects in this book. Older siblings might pinch one or two as well. Favourite projects are the knitted animals. I also like the felted boxes made by knitting pieces, then felting in a washing machine. There is also a quilt that is a mix of knitting and fabric. These projects are very well designed. Beautifully photographed with easy to follow patterns, in a good font size that is easy to read. Recommended. * Karen Platt- yarnsandfabrics.co.uk * Wow I have been crocheting for a number of years and I am extremely surprised by the amount of new stitch designs to make afghans. The use of the different stitches and colours have created the most amazing mix. Each of the designs include a swatch picture, written pattern and in chart form. Each design gives you the level of crocheter so there are many different designs for different levels of crocheter. Not only can you use these fantastic designs to create your own afghan you can use them to design many more things. I love the idea of creating different blocks from within the book and making them into an afghan. This book is fantastic value for money. Not only do you get so many different patterns you also get beautiful colour ideas. Not only do you get access to the patterns you also get access to Annie&#39;s stitch guide online. I would highly recommend this book. Full of amazing designs. * Crochet Addict UK * Looking for something to make for a new baby? There are fourteen projects in this book for toys, accessories and decorations to knit. Many of these form neat sets of items that will look great in any nursery with their modern, uncluttered style. An intermediate level of expertise is required as this is a book of patterns and skills include intarsia, reading charts, felting and toy making. This is particularly a book for those who enjoy intarsia as there is a lot of it in here, with rugs, blankets and pillows featuring pictures that are echoed in the toys or hanging decorations. Choose from birds, elephants, rabbits or owls in bright, cheerful colors and make the most of Rowan yarns, some pieces also featuring cotton-quilting fabrics. I&#39;ve looked at lots of other books purporting to have toys suitable for babies but these really do seem to fit the bill. They have embroidered features and no &#34;hard bits&#34; or trailing parts apart from the squirrel&#39;s scarf which can be removed. You won&#39;t find photographic staged instructions in here but patterns written out and some charts for the intarsia, as well as lots of handsome photos of the items made up and displayed. This is a spaciously laid out book with large print and an airy, roomy feel to it that fits the unfussy style of the items. This is an attractive, modern book that is sure to appeal to any competent knitter looking for something to give a new baby. * Rachel Hyde - Myshelf.com * I get to review lots of craft books of this ilk and I am pleased to say this one contains very little of all that feature writing fluff and nonsense which is refreshing. The photography promotes the projects very well. The project ideas have a wonderful modern take on nursery themes and are quite charming, and there would be a real sense of accomplishment if one is able to reproduce any one of the 14 items to match the quality presented in the book. This is best described as a &#39;how to do&#39; pattern style book for those with some knitting and sewing crafting proficiency.

Rather than advertising products, Wall's photographs celebrate moments of everyday life, often ones he has observed while driving around the streets of his native Vancouver, and then re-created using actors. His use of the light box as a medium has been copied by many younger artists, and his theoretical writings on photography are widely admired. <br><br>This book is part of a Tate Publishing series focused on living artists. Generously illustrated, accessible, and affordable, the Modern Artists series will build to become an essential reference for all those interested in contemporary visual culture.</p><p>Craig Burnett is a writer and the assistant editor of the V&amp;A Magazine.

During the day, 10-year-old Mary Geddy concentrates on her chores, knowing that if the outcome of the vote is for independence her father will go to war as a patriot while her friend Anne's family, loyal to the king, will be moving back to England. Clear, crisp, colorful photographs of characters in traditional clothing taken in Williamsburg lend authenticity to the story. The author provides readers with information on Colonial life complete with colloquialisms ("William is not worth a button") as well as a story they can relate to the possibility of a best friend moving away. Readers who enjoyed Waters's Sarah Morton's Day (1989) and Samuel Eaton's Day (1993, both Scholastic) will want to read this one as well.

Illustrated with large, easy-to-follow drawings, this is a guide to an aspect of the sport that is frequently overlooked in the zeal to catch fish. But as anyone who has perfected a variety of casts can tell you, fly presentation is a key to success, and a large part of presentation is putting the fly exactly where you want it.For fly casters, the difference between catching fish and not catching fish often boils down to whether a caster can place the fly in a square yard of water - or a square inch. Fly-casting accuracy is a function of concentration, technique, and above all, training. And few people have trained more accomplished fly casters than Joan Wulff.Using teaching methods honed over thousands of students, Wulff leads readers through layers of elemental skills that when combined provide casters with the tools to deliver a fly consistently to a square inch of water - overhead cast or roll cast, off-shoulder or side arm, windy day or still, short cast or long.

For one, it was a signal mercy which cemented his reputation and paved the way for political as well as military supremacy. For the other, it meant defeat, occupation, and the end of a cause. In England, Dunbar is remembered as one of Cromwell&#x2019;s most brilliant victories. In Scotland, as an avoidable tragedy caused by the placement of blind faith over sound judgement. And for those whose ancestors suffered in its terrible aftermath, it is a story of both sorrow and survival.<br><br>This new analysis of the Battle of Dunbar explores the battlefield and its events in close detail, using the author&#x2019;s intimate knowledge of the landscape. From the high politics to the individual experience, Arran Johnston brings the story of the Dunbar campaign vividly to life and sets its significance within the context of both the seventeenth century and our own times.</p><p>Dr Arran Paul Johnston was born and raised in Derbyshire, where he first discovered the interest in the Jacobite Risings which would later lead him to Scotland. Arran graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an MA(hons) in Latin and Ancient History, and achieved his doctorate on the Scottish diaspora at the University of the West of Scotland. Arran is the founder and director of the Scottish Battlefields Trust, campaigning for greater understanding and protection for Scotland&#x2019;s battlefield heritage. He lives with his wife and two children in Dunbar, where he is leading new interpretation and engagement initiatives raising the profile of the 1650 battlefield.</p><h2>The Book of Afternoon Tea</h2><p>Now cooks everywhere can master the time-honored tradition of afternoon tea.

The town of Foxbury (inhabited by foxes) enjoys its own unique style of law enforcement. Every morning, the local constables primp and prepare for inspection. One morning a month, the town burglars carry out a mock burglary, which gives the constables much-needed practice in criminal catching. Usually, civility reigns throughout. This time, however, the Foreman Burglar decides that his group should commit a real theft. Of course, neither party has any experience with true crime, and the result is a wild, slapstick romp that will delight youngsters. As in his earlier books, Oakley employs a winning combination of sometimes exaggerated, sometimes understated tongue-in-cheek humor. Much of the amusement springs from his typically lively, detailed line-and-wash illustrations. The visual story enhances and expands the zany narrative. This book is sure to please Oakley's loyal fans as well as add to his following.<br><i>Heide Piehler, Shorewood Public Library, WI</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Once a month in the village of Foxbury, the Town Burglars stage a robbery to provide the local constabulary with a little policing practice. However, when the Foreman Burglar decides to speed off with the glittery proceeds from a jewelry heist, the foxy police force is obliged to follow in hot pursuit. Oakley's (the Church Mice books) unlikely text bubbles with wit ("He knew they were too honest to be trusted") as it moves briskly through plot twists and good-natured surprises. Highly detailed illustrations extend the humor with small touches (foxes dressed down in flowery underwear, a country cottage sporting a cable dish) as the FPD shows little guile and less cunning. Especially appealing are scenes from the car chase and a set of inserts depicting the police force, truncheons at the ready, as they tiptoe through the darkness of an old castle. Much fun, and plenty of child-appeal.

She tasted them. Held up her hands to catch them. They touched her like a kiss.</p><p>There were footprints in the fallen snow. Large. Not hers. Marks made by a man. But they were old, the edges of the outlines rounded, blurred. The man was long gone. She looked down at her own red shoes. Would she fit her feet within the marks the man had made? They led away across the white field toward the fence of trees that was the edge of the forest. Stark black trunks, limbs burdened, clotted with snow. Yes.</p><p>Suddenly convinced, she hurried forward, the deep, soft powder creaking beneath her Spanish slippers. But she was hot, not cold, as she stepped into the hollows of the footprints in the snow. She had to stretch to match his stride -- he'd been tall, this man -- and she could feel it in her thighs, her knees.</p><p>And then she was among the trees, breathless, starting to hurry, trying to run, trying not to flounder, stumbling on though her skirts were wet and heavy. Her mantle was a burden. Throw it away, that was best, she would not be so hot. Impatiently she dragged at the cloak pin, a gold dragon with milk-white eyes of pearl. It ripped the heavy velvet as she tugged, but she didn't care. She threw the precious garment down beside a naked hawthorn tree, the last blood-dark berries shriveled on the twigs, some caught into icicles, the fingers of winter. Perhaps she would come back and find the blue cloak later. Only perhaps.</p><p>She was strong, she knew that, but every part of her was in pain as she struggled to be faithful to the marks in the snow, her chest heaving with the effort of moving forward, plowing forward. The footprints led her on. She allowed herself to feel hope now, to believe that she was close. That soon, if only she ignored the agony in her knees, her side, her throat, she would find him, the man who'd made them. She was clear on that -- she wanted that. She must find him, ask him why he had . . . what? Gone on this weary journey, of course, when all the world was deep asleep, locked in the depths of rigid winter.</p><p>And it made her happy, knowing she would find him, so happy that nothing else mattered. She would see this man, touch him, hold his face between her hands. She would feel the sharp day-old stubble on his skin, she would taste his mouth softly, and he would hold her. Not concentrating, Anne stumbled, falling suddenly into the cold, soft snow. She laughed. She liked snow, liked the feel of it, only it was important to brush it off quickly so the cold did not travel to the skin. First she would sit up, then she would stand, and then . . .</p><p>She saw the wolf. Smelled her. This white world had no smell, but the wolf did -- a rank, dog-slobber stench. The creature was yellow-eyed, all sinew, no fat this deep in winter. Ravenous, and pregnant. Anne was fresh meat, a happy bonus in the frozen world of the wolf.</p><p>Anne heard herself scream, the sound given up from deep in her chest, as the wolf sprang. The animal's weight hit her and teeth, hard yellow teeth, ripped and connected within her throat; blood, blood was everywhere. White pain, white snow and blood, a sea of blood, soft red blood. How could blood be so soft?</p><p>The wolf was shaking her now, shaking Anne's shoulder. Addressing her, while ripping at her tender flesh.</p><p>"Anne? Anne, all is well. Anne?"</p><p>Yes, perhaps all would be well. Dying was easy; she'd always known that. Anne sighed. These were the last things she would ever feel; she allowed her hands to pat the soft red snow as her body flopped this way and that, shaken by the wolf as the creature went about her work.</p><p>"Anne? Wake now, sweetheart. Wake!"</p><p></p><p>It was the counterpane -- red silk and goose down, that was all. Her hand was white against it and there was no blood.</p><p>"No blood?"</p><p>Deborah, Anne's foster mother, swallowed acid fear as she held the girl tight against her own body. "No blood. All's well now."</p><p>The dream had gone but the forest had not quite left Anne de Bohun. She still saw the footprints leading her on. Old footprints, lost in the snow. The girl closed her eyes against tears as Deborah kissed her brow, soothed damp, tangled hair back from her face.</p><p>Anne knew who the man was now. Edward Plantagenet.</p><p>"Will you pray before the break-fast?" Deborah's tone was carefully brisk, formal, as she tidied the bed. Anne was glad, suddenly, that her foster mother -- her housekeeper in the eyes of the world -- was practical. She was right. It was time to begin the day, time to leave the night world, and there was much to be done as autumn approached winter. They must also think about protecting the farm from brigands, in these uncertain times. For that they would need money.</p><p>Anne sat up, huddling the bedclothes around her bare shoulders. It was dark still but the branch of candles on the shelf beside the fire made a show of challenging the gloom, as did the fire on its newly built hearth.</p><p>"Yes, I should like to pray with the household. But I've slept late. Perhaps I'm the last down and they're all about their work already?"</p><p>Deborah, splashing hot water from an ewer into the washing bowl by the fire, smiled at the girl in the great bed.</p><p>"Do not distress yourself. We've all been working hard these weeks with the harvest. You most of all, and -- " She'd been about to say, "You needed a good sleep," but stopped herself. There'd been far too many nightmares recently, as this last night showed.</p><p>Anne was determined the wolf's shadow would not enter her daylight world. Slipping down from the high mattress, she groped on the boards beneath the bed for her felt house slippers. "And little Edward?" Anne shivered, naked, toward the fire and the comfort of the dressing mantle -- an extravagance from her former life.</p><p>"In the kitchen. A matter of new bread, I think. He could smell it when he woke."</p><p>Both women laughed and the dark air moved and shifted with the sound. Anne's son, the boy she called her nephew, was three, though tall for his age, quick, and speaking well. She was proud that many people, on first meeting him, thought him at least five. She would laugh and say, "Ah, yes. It's the good food he gets here. He grows like a weed outside the town. Boys need space."</p><p>There was always comfort in the ritual of washing and dressing for Anne and Deborah. It was almost the only time during the day that they could expect to be alone together; that was, if the noisy boy they both so deeply loved was not bouncing around on the great bed, demanding that they both hurry, hurry, down to the kitchen and break-fast.</p><p>"House dress, or fine?"</p><p>"House dress, Deborah. We've much to do today."</p><p>Anne avoided her foster mother's glance. Their current situation was her responsibility and it weighed on her. Hoping for greater freedom outside the narrow life of the city, she'd brought them all to this little farm beyond the walls of Brugge. Yet now that war, rumored and actual, was spreading through Europe, she could not avoid the uncertainty of their situation. There were hard questions to be asked. And there were no easy answers.</p><p>Preoccupied, Anne washed herself quickly in the warming air. Light from candles and the fire touched her body like a loving hand. She was gracefully made, with curving hips; a straight, well-muscled back; high, delicate breasts with tawny rose nipples -- larger for having had a child -- and strong, slender arms and legs from all the work she did.</p><p>Deborah sighed and turned away to find the girl a house dress. There were so many things they did not speak of anymore. Marriage, that was what Anne needed. A real flesh-and-blood marriage, not an insubstantial, passionate dream that receded, day by day, into enchanted mist. Marriage was an alliance, a contract designed for mutual aid and support between a man and a woman; such a contract would protect Anne and the boy and her household as the constant dangerous wrangling between Burgundy and France escalated. It was a shame, and a waste, that nearly two years since their last meeting, her foster daughter still yearned for the one man she could not have. Edward, the English king; Edward Plantagenet, her son's father. A thousand miles away over the sea, but closer than thought to Anne -- always closer than thought.</p><p>But things changed when they needed to and there was an unexpected cause for new hope in their lives. Last night, very late, Leif Molnar had arrived from Sluys -- too late to talk, except to say he'd come from Sir Mathew. Perhaps Leif brought Anne a solution? Perhaps they would all go back to London, to Sir Mathew's house, until the wrangling between France and Burgundy resolved itself? Yet England, too, was in turmoil. There was even talk that Edward Plantagenet might lose his throne. Perhaps nowhere was safe anymore?</p><p>Deborah took a house dress down from its peg and shook it vigorously. Concentrate on the moment, banish gloom with hard work. "The worsted? It's clean still. Which sleeves would you like?"</p><p>"You choose, Deborah. I don't mind."</p><p>The kirtle was designed for work and not for show, but it was still a pretty thing. Dark red, it had several pairs of sleeves that could be swapped depending on mood. Deborah, thinking the day would be sullen, chose a set in cheerful crocus yellow, piped with blue to match the blue lacings of the dress. She knew that Anne liked color, particularly as the days drew in. The older woman also found a linen chemise for her daughter. Anne appreciated the warmth and durability of her own good woolen cloth, but was sensitive to its itch against her skin. She always had been, even as a little girl.</p><p>Footed hose, a practical luxury, were laid up in a fruitwood coffer. These would be tied beneath the knee with ribbon. Lastly, there was an apron of forest-green serge and a thick shawl, its warp bright blue wool with a startling weft of yellow silk.</p><p>Helping the girl dress, Deborah worked, crabwise, toward her design for the future. "So, what do you think our neighbors will ask for the plow land?"</p><p>As Deborah laced the kirtle, Anne stared out toward the first faint light in the east.</p><p>"I'm not cer...</p></p><h2>Breach of Peace: Portraits of the 1961 Mississippi Freedom Riders</h2><p><p><strong>A beautifully-produced book that celebrates the Freedom Riders, featuring rare-seen mug shots alongside stunning contemporary portraits.</strong></p>In the spring and summer of 1961, several hundred Americans&#x2014;blacks and whites, men and women&#x2014;converged on Jackson, Mississippi, to challenge state segregation laws. The Freedom Riders, as they came to be known, were determined to open up the South to civil rights: it was illegal for bus and train stations to discriminate, but most did and were not interested in change. Over 300 people were arrested and convicted of the charge "breach of the peace."<br> <br> The name, mug shot, and other personal details of each Freedom Rider arrested were duly recorded and saved by agents of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a Stasi-like investigative agency whose purpose was to "perform any and all acts deemed necessary and proper to protect the sovereignty of the state of Mississippi." How the Commission thought these details would actually protect the state is not clear, but what is clear, forty-six years later, is that by carefully recording names and preserving the mug shots, the Commission inadvertently created a testament to these heroes of the civil rights movement.<br> <br> Collected here in a richly illustrated, large-format book featuring over seventy contemporary photographs, alongside the original mug shots, and exclusive interviews with former Freedom Riders, is that testament: a moving archive of a chapter in U.S. history that hasn't yet closed. <br></p><p><strong>Eric Etheridge</strong> grew up in Carthage, Mississippi.

The victims were crushed in a manner surpassing human power. And while recent attempts on her majesty's life raise a number of possibilities, these intrigues also seem strangely connected to an act of evil that took place centuries earlier...<br><br>For indeed, the slaying of David Rizzio, music master and friend to Mary Queen of Scots, was an extraordinarily brutal and treacherous act--even for a time when brutality and treachery were the order of the day. Now, the ghosts of Holyrood House are being reawakened by someone with a diabolical agenda of greed, madness, and terror as Holmes and Watson set out to trap a killer who is eager to rewrite history in blood...<br></p><p>Although Sherlock Holmes categorically dismissed, in "The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire," supernatural explanations for corporeal crimes ("This Agency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. ... No ghosts need apply"), one of the most popular among Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s Holmes tales is <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> (1902), in which the fate of a Devonshire family supposedly hangs on the savage appetites of an apparitional beast. More than a century later, in <i>The Italian Secretary</i>, Caleb Carr again presents the hawk-faced consulting detective with a yarn woven of paranormal plot threads, the mystery this time rooted in the fatal 16th-century stabbing of David Rizzio, a music teacher and confidant to Mary, Queen of Scots.<p> For Holmes and his affable annalist, Dr. John Watson, this spirited escapade begins sometime in the late 19th century with their receipt, in London, of an encrypted telegram from Sherlock's eccentric elder brother, Mycroft, "a senior but anonymous government official." It summons them to Edinburgh, Scotland, where architect Sir Alistair Sinclair and his foreman, Dennis McKay, have been slain in the midst of rehabilitating the medieval west tower of the Royal Palace of Holyrood--the very wing where Queen Mary had lived, and where Rizzio had met his brutal, politically motivated end. Mycroft fears these murders portend new threats against Britain's present monarch--the elderly Queen Victoria, who infrequently lodges at the palace--by a known assassin, perhaps in nefarious league with the German Kaiser. En route north, Holmes and Watson are menaced aboard their train by a red-bearded bomb thrower (supposedly a rabid Scots nationalist), only to discover that still greater dangers await them, and others, at Holyroodhouse. The plaintive drone of a weeping woman, cruelly punctured and shattered corpses, a pool of blood "that never dries," and a disembodied Italian voice with unexpected musical tastes all imply the wrath of wraiths behind recent atrocities. But Holmes and Watson deduce that greed, rather than ghosts, may be to blame.</p><p> Carr, who earned renown with his historical mysteries, <i>The Alienist</i> (1994) and <i>The Angel of Darkness</i> (1997), apparently intended <i>The Italian Secretary</i> to be a short story; however, he couldn't stop writing. The result is a fleet-footed, atmospherically gothic, and often amusing Holmes tale (with an exposition scene in Watson's bed chamber that&#x2019;s truly priceless), but one that makes scant attempt to enhance our understanding of Conan Doyle's characters--a less ambitious undertaking, in that respect, than Mitch Cullin's concurrently published <i>A Slight Trick of the Mind</i>. And while Carr displays a gift here for adopting another author's literary techniques, it is really his own style and series players that his fans are waiting to see more of in the future. --<i>J. Kingston Pierce</i></p><i>Caleb Carr's novel, </i>The Alienist<i>, </i><i>was a blockbuster international bestseller and positioned its author as a modern master of the historical thriller.

The second she walked into the kitchen she felt the hostility, like the bone-deep cold of the wind that blew through the streets of Berlin before a February snowstorm. She almost turned and walked back out again.</p><p>It was unusual for them to fight. Mostly they were affectionate&#x2014;too much so. Carla cringed when they kissed in front of other people. Her friends thought it was strange: their parents did not do that. She had said that to her mother, once. Mother had laughed in a pleased way and said: &#x201c;The day after our wedding, your father and I were separated by the Great War.&#x201d; She had been born English, though you could hardly tell. &#x201c;I stayed in London while he came home to Germany and joined the army.&#x201d; Carla had heard this story many times, but Mother never tired of telling it. &#x201c;We thought the war would last three months, but I didn&#x2019;t see him again for five years. All that time I longed to touch him. Now I never tire of it.&#x201d;</p><p>Father was just as bad. &#x201c;Your mother is the cleverest woman I ever met,&#x201d; he had said here in the kitchen just a few days ago. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I married her. It had nothing to do with . . .&#x201d; He had trailed off, and Mother and he had giggled conspiratorially, as if Carla at the age of eleven knew nothing about sex. It was so embarrassing.</p><p>But once in a while they had a quarrel. Carla knew the signs. And a new one was about to erupt.</p><p>They were sitting at opposite ends of the kitchen table. Father was somberly dressed in a dark gray suit, starched white shirt, and black satin tie. He looked dapper, as always, even though his hair was receding and his waistcoat bulged a little beneath the gold watch chain. His face was frozen in an expression of false calm. Carla knew that look. He wore it when one of the family had done something that angered him.</p><p>He held in his hand a copy of the weekly magazine for which Mother worked, The Democrat. She wrote a column of political and diplomatic gossip under the name of Lady Maud. Father began to read aloud. &#x201c;&#x2018; &#x2018;Our new chancellor, Herr Adolf Hitler, made his debut in diplomatic society at President Hindenburg&#x2019;s reception.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>The president was the head of state, Carla knew. He was elected, but he stood above the squabbles of day-to-day politics, acting as referee. The chancellor was the premier. Although Hitler had been made chancellor, his Nazi Party did not have an overall majority in the Reichstag&#x2014;the German parliament&#x2014;so, for the present, the other parties could restrain Nazi excesses.</p><p>Father spoke with distaste, as if forced to mention something repellent, like sewage. &#x201c; &#x2018;He looked uncomfortable in a formal tailcoat.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>Carla&#x2019;s mother sipped her coffee and looked out of the window to the street, as if interested in the people hurrying to work in scarves and gloves. She, too, was pretending to be calm, but Carla knew she was just waiting for her moment.</p><p>The maid, Ada, was standing at the counter in an apron, slicing cheese. She put a plate in front of Father, but he ignored it. &#x201c; &#x2018;Herr Hitler was evidently charmed by Elisabeth Cerruti, the cultured wife of the Italian ambassador, in a rose-pink velvet gown trimmed with sable.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>Mother always wrote about what people were wearing. She said it helped the reader picture them. She herself had fine clothes, but times were hard and she had not bought anything new for years. This morning she looked slim and elegant in a navy blue cashmere dress that was probably as old as Carla.</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2018;Signora Cerruti, who is Jewish, is a passionate Fascist, and they talked for many minutes. Did she beg Hitler to stop whipping up hatred of Jews?&#x2019;&#x201d; Father put the magazine down on the table with a slap.</p><p>Here it comes, Carla thought.</p><p>&#x201c;You realize that will infuriate the Nazis,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope so,&#x201d; Mother said coolly. &#x201c;The day they&#x2019;re pleased with what I write, I shall give it up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re dangerous when riled.&#x201d;</p><p>Mother&#x2019;s eyes flashed anger. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare condescend to me, Walter. I know they&#x2019;re dangerous&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why I oppose them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t see the point of making them irate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You attack them in the Reichstag.&#x201d; Father was an elected parliamentary representative for the Social Democratic Party.</p><p>&#x201c;I take part in a reasoned debate.&#x201d;</p><p>This is typical, Carla thought. Father was logical, cautious, law-abiding. Mother had style and humor. He got his way by quiet persistence, she with charm and cheek. They would never agree.</p><p>Father added: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t drive the Nazis mad with fury.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps that&#x2019;s because you don&#x2019;t do them much harm.&#x201d;</p><p>Father was irritated by her quick wit. His voice became louder. &#x201c;And you think you damage them with jokes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I mock them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s your substitute for argument.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe we need both.&#x201d;</p><p>Father became angrier. &#x201c;But, Maud, don&#x2019;t you see how you&#x2019;re putting yourself and your family at risk?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On the contrary. The real danger is not to mock the Nazis. What would life be like for our children if Germany became a Fascist state?&#x201d;</p><p>This kind of talk made Carla feel queasy. She could not bear to hear that the family was in danger. Life must go on as it always had. She wished she could sit in this kitchen for an eternity of mornings, with her parents at opposite ends of the pine table, Ada at the counter, and her brother, Erik, thumping around upstairs, late again. Why should anything change?</p><p>She had listened to political talk every breakfast-time of her life and she thought she understood what her parents did, and how they planned to make Germany a better place for everyone. But lately they had begun to talk in a different way. They seemed to think that a terrible danger loomed, but Carla could not quite imagine what it was.</p><p>Father said: &#x201c;God knows I&#x2019;m doing everything I can to hold back Hitler and his mob.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And so am I. But, when you do it, you believe you&#x2019;re following a sensible course.&#x201d; Mother&#x2019;s face hardened in resentment. &#x201c;And when I do it I&#x2019;m accused of putting the family at risk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And with good reason,&#x201d; said Father. The row was only just getting started, but at that moment Erik came down, clattering like a horse on the stairs, and lurched into the kitchen with his school satchel swinging from his shoulder. He was thirteen, two years older than Carla, and there were unsightly black hairs sprouting from his upper lip. When they were small, Carla and Erik had played together all the time; but those days were over, and since he had grown so tall he had pretended to think she was stupid and childish. In fact she was smarter than he, and knew about a lot of things he did not understand, such as women&#x2019;s monthly cycles.</p><p>&#x201c;What was that last tune you were playing?&#x201d; he said to Mother.</p><p>The piano often woke them in the morning. It was a Steinway grand&#x2014;inherited, like the house itself, from Father&#x2019;s parents. Mother played in the morning because, she said, she was too busy the rest of the day and too tired in the evening. This morning she had performed a Mozart sonata, then a jazz tune. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;Tiger Rag,&#x2019;&#x201d; she told Erik. &#x201c;Do you want some cheese?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jazz is decadent,&#x201d; Erik said.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly.&#x201d;</p><p>Ada handed Erik a plate of cheese and sliced sausage, and he began to shovel it in. Carla thought his manners were dreadful.</p><p>Father looked severe. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s been teaching you this nonsense, Erik?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hermann Braun says that jazz isn&#x2019;t music, just Negroes making a noise.&#x201d; Hermann was Erik&#x2019;s best friend; his father was a member of the Nazi Party.</p><p>&#x201c;Hermann should try to play it.&#x201d; Father looked at Mother, and his face softened. She smiled at him. He went on: &#x201c;Your mother tried to teach me ragtime, many years ago, but I couldn&#x2019;t master the rhythm.&#x201d;</p><p>Mother laughed. &#x201c;It was like trying to get a giraffe to roller-skate.&#x201d;</p><p>The fight was over, Carla saw with relief. She began to feel better. She took some black bread and dipped it in milk.</p><p>But now Erik wanted an argument. &#x201c;Negroes are an inferior race,&#x201d; he said defiantly.</p><p>&#x201c;I doubt that,&#x201d; Father said patiently. &#x201c;If a Negro boy were brought up in a nice house full of books and paintings, and sent to an expensive school with good teachers, he might turn out to be smarter than you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s ridiculous!&#x201d; Erik protested.</p><p>Mother put in: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call your father ridiculous, you foolish boy.&#x201d; Her tone was mild: she had used up her anger on Father. Now she just sounded wearily disappointed. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about, and neither does Hermann Braun.&#x201d;</p><p>Erik said: &#x201c;But the Aryan race must be superior&#x2014;we rule the world!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your Nazi friends don&#x2019;t know any history,&#x201d; Father said. &#x201c;The Ancient Egyptians built the pyramids when Germans were living in caves. Arabs ruled the world in the Middle Ages&#x2014;the Muslims were doing algebra when German princes could not write their own names. It&#x2019;s nothing to do with race.&#x201d;</p><p>Carla frowned and said: &#x201c;What is it to do with, then?&#x201d;</p><p>Father looked at her fondly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a very good question, and you&#x2019;re a bright girl to ask it.&#x201d; She glowed with pleasure at his praise. &#x201c;Civilizations rise and fall&#x2014;the Chinese, the Aztecs, the Romans&#x2014;but no one really knows why.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eat up, everyone, and put your coats on,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting late.&#x201d;</p><p>Father pulled his watch out of his waistcoat pocket and looked at it with raised eyebrows. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not late.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to take Carla to the Francks&#x2019; house,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;The girls&#x2019; school is closed for a day&#x2014;something about repairing the furnace&#x2014;so Carla&#x2019;s going to spend today with Frieda.&#x201d;</p><p>Frieda Franck was Carla&#x2019;s best friend. Their mothers were best friends, too. In fact, when they were young, Frieda&#x2019;s mother, Monika, had been in love with Father&#x2014;a hilarious fact that Frieda&#x2019;s grandmother had revealed one day after drinking too much Sekt.</p><p>Father said: &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t Ada look after Carla?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ada has an appointment with the doctor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;</p><p>Carla expected Father to ask what was wrong with Ada, but he nodded as if he already knew, and put his watch away. Carla wanted to ask, but something told her she should not. She made a mental note to ask Mother later. Then she immediately forgot about it.</p><p>Father left first, wearing a long black overcoat. Then Erik put on his cap&#x2014;perching it as far back on his head as it would go without falling off, as was the fashion among his friends&#x2014;and followed Father out of the door.</p><p>Carla and her mother helped Ada clear the table. Carla loved Ada almost as much as she loved her mother. When Carla was little, Ada had taken care of her full-time, until she was old enough to go to school, for Mother had always worked. Ada was not married yet. She was twenty-nine and homely-looking, though she had a lovely kind smile. Last summer she had had a romance with a policeman, Paul Huber, but it had not lasted.</p><p>Carla and her mother stood in front of the mirror in the hall and put on their hats. Mother took her time. She chose a dark blue felt, with a round crown and a narrow brim, the type all the women were wearing, but she tilted hers at a different angle, making it look chic. As Carla put on her knitted wool cap, she wondered whether she would ever have Mother&#x2019;s sense of style. Mother looked like a goddess of war, her long neck and chin and cheekbones carved out of white marble; beautiful, yes, but definitely not pretty. Carla had the same dark hair and green eyes, but looked more like a plump doll than a statue. Carla had once accidentally overheard her grandmother say to Mother: &#x201c;Your ugly duckling will grow into a swan, you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; Carla was still waiting for it to happen.</p><p>When Mother was ready, they went out. Their home stood in a row of tall, gracious town houses in the Mitte district, the old center of the city, built for high-ranking ministers and army officers such as Carla&#x2019;s grandfather, who had worked at the nearby government buildings.</p><p>Carla and her mother rode a tram along Unter den Linden, then took the S train from Friedrich Strasse to the Zoo Station. The Francks lived in the southwestern suburb of Sch�neberg.</p><p>Carla was hoping to see Frieda&#x2019;s brother Werner, who was fourteen. She liked him. Sometimes Carla and Frieda imagined they each married the other&#x2019;s brother, and were next-door neighbors, and their children were best friends. It was just a game to Frieda, but Carla was secretly serious. Werner was handsome and grown-up and not a bit silly like Erik. In the dollhouse in Carla&#x2019;s bedroom, the mother and father sleeping side by side in the miniature double bed were called Carla and Werner, but no one knew that, not even Frieda.</p><p>Frieda had another brother, Axel, seven, but he had been born with spina bifida, and had to have constant medical care. He lived in a special hospital on the outskirts of Berlin.</p><p>Mother was preoccupied on the journey. &#x201c;I hope this is going to be all right,&#x201d; she muttered, half to herself, as they got off the train.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course it will,&#x201d; Carla said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a lovely time with Frieda.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean that. I&#x2019;m talking about my paragraph about Hitler.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we in danger? Was Father right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your father is usually right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What will happen to us if we&#x2019;ve annoyed the Nazis?&#x201d;</p><p>Mother stared at her strangely for a long moment, then said: &#x201c;Dear God, what kind of a world did I bring you into?&#x201d; Then she went quiet.</p><p>After a ten-minute walk they arrived at a grand villa in a big garden. The Francks were rich: Frieda&#x2019;s father, Ludwig, owned a factory making radio sets. Two cars stood in the driveway. The large shiny black one belonged to Herr Franck. The engine rumbled, and a cloud of blue vapor rose from the tailpipe. The chauffeur, Ritter, with uniform trousers tucked into high boots, stood cap in hand ready to open the door. He bowed and said: &#x201c;Good morning, Frau von Ulrich.&#x201d;</p><p>The second car was a little green two-seater. A short man with a gray beard came out of the house carrying a leather case, and touched his hat to Mother as he got into the small car. &#x201c;I wonder what Dr. Rothmann is doing here so early in the morning,&#x201d; Mother said anxiously.</p><p>They soon found out. Frieda&#x2019;s mother, Monika, came to the door, a tall woman with a mass of red hair. Anxiety showed on her pale face. Instead of welcoming them in, she stood squarely in the doorway as if to bar their entrance. &#x201c;Frieda has measles!&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry!&#x201d; said Mother. &#x201c;How is she?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Miserable. She has a fever and a cough. But Rothmann says she&#x2019;ll be all right. However, she&#x2019;s quarantined.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. Have you had it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;when I was a girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And Werner has, too&#x2014;I remember he had a terrible rash all over. But what about your husband?&#x201d; Mother asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Ludi had it as a boy.&#x201d;</p><p>Both women looked at Carla. She had never had measles. She realized this meant she could not spend the day with Frieda.</p><p>Carla was disappointed, but Mother was quite shaken. &#x201c;This week&#x2019;s magazine is our election issue&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t be absent.&#x201d; She looked distraught. All the grown-ups were apprehensive about the general election to be held next Sunday. Mother and Father both feared the Nazis might do well enough to take full control of the government. &#x201c;Plus my oldest friend is visiting fro...</p></p><h2>The Blue Fox</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the Nordic Council Literature Prize </b></p><p><b>'Enchantingly poetic . . . spellbinding . . . magical . . . exceptional' <i>Independent </i></b></p><p>The year is 1883.

How do the badly predatory behavior and wasteful extinction of whole species fit in with a Christian understanding?<p></p><br>These and a host of related questions raised by ordinary experience are tackled in this important and original work from theologian Denis Edwards. From providence and miracles to resurrection and intercessory prayer, Edwards shows how a basically noninterventionist model of divine action does justice to the universe as we know it and also to central convictions of Christian faith about the goodness of God, the promises of God, and the fulfillment of creation. Here is wonderfully lucid theology supporting a vision of how God is at work in the universe.</p><p>Denis Edwards is Senior Lecturer in Systematic Theology in the School of Theology of Flinders University. An internationally acclaimed theologian, he is author of many works, including recently Ecology at the Heart of Faith (2006) and The God of Evolution: A Trinitarian Theology (1999).&#34;In this marvelous book Denis Edwards, a key contributor to &#39;theology and science&#39; today, demonstrates how our understanding of God&#39;s special action in the world such as the incarnation, resurrection, miracles, God&#39;s answering prayer can be given fresh and invigorating illumination as &#39;non-interventionist&#39; and &#39;participatory&#39; by drawing on the insights of Karl Rahner, Thomas Aquinas, and Athanasius in dialogue with the natural sciences. The result is the beginning of a consistent integrated model of divine action with these sciences. Edwards&#39;s book should be required reading for scholars and non-technical readers interested in the growing dialogue between theology and science.&#34; --Robert John Russell, Ian G.

This Inner Space was experienced by shamans and the 'Wise Ones' of all cultures and traditions who could bring to the surface of consciousness knowledge that could then be applied to improve the quality of individual lives. Today, the opportunity exists for us all to experience the reality of transcending distance and time, find new understanding, and discover the inspiration and guidance to meet all of life's challenges.Shamanic Experience, packaged together with its unique shamanic drumming CD, can enable you to:-- awaken and develop your inner senses &amp; resources-- access other levels of awareness and retrieve information that is relevant to all areas of your life -- discover that the power of every living thing, including yourself, lies within</p><p>Kenneth Meadows is internationally respected for his work in adapting ancient shamanic wisdom to modern times.

While the authors have supplied guidance in the practical matters, such as reading the Almanac and carrying out sight reductions (there are reduction forms in the appendices), they have also provided an understanding of the principles so the sailor can invent new methods when required. Readers are expected to be active participants, and there are many exercises designed to help them along the way. What makes this book different from most others is its focus on three methods used in a Harvard freshman tutorial course: confrontation with misconceptions, definitions based on procedures, and the use of imaginary scenarios. The authors feel these are keys to learning, as they are much more powerful than memorization of rules and will prepare the sailor to handle situations that are not in any textbook. Whitney and Wright have directed their writing to the sailor who is interested in the principles but not particularly comfortable with geometry.</p><p></p><h2>Survival Guide for Coaching Youth Softball</h2><p>SUPERANNO More than 1.6 million youth participate in softball and each year thousands of first-time coaches take on the daunting task of teaching them how to play the game.

They wanted to study the wild blue sheep, the bharal, but also hoped to see the snow leopard, a creature so rarely spotted as to be nearly mythical. &#34;The Snow Leopard&#34; is not only an exquisite book of natural history but an extraordinary account of an inner journey; a &#39;true pilgrimage, a journey of the heart&#39;.</p><p>In the autumn of 1973, the writer Peter Matthiessen set out in the company of zoologist George Schaller on a hike that would take them 250 miles into the heart of the Himalayan region of Dolpo, "the last enclave of pure Tibetan culture on earth." Their voyage was in quest of one of the world's most elusive big cats, the snow leopard of high Asia, a creature so rarely spotted as to be nearly mythical; Schaller was one of only two Westerners known to have seen a snow leopard in the wild since 1950.<p> Published in 1978, <i>The Snow Leopard</i> is rightly regarded as a classic of modern nature writing. Guiding his readers through steep-walled canyons and over tall mountains, Matthiessen offers a narrative that is shot through with metaphor and mysticism, and his arduous search for the snow leopard becomes a vehicle for reflections on all manner of matters of life and death. In the process, <i>The Snow Leopard</i> evolves from an already exquisite book of natural history and travel into a grand, Buddhist-tinged parable of our search for meaning. By the end of their expedition, having seen wolves, foxes, rare mountain sheep, and other denizens of the Himalayas, and having seen many signs of the snow leopard but not the cat itself, Schaller muses, "We've seen so much, maybe it's better if there are some things that we don't see."</p><p> That sentiment, as well as the sense of wonder at the world's beauty that pervades Matthiessen's book, ought to inform any journey into the wild. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Peter Matthiessen was a naturalist, explorer and writer. His works of fiction include At Play in the Fields of the Lord, Far Tortuga and the acclaimed &#39;Watson Trilogy&#39;.

But for years, the lives of these women have remained shrouded in mystery. Here, artist Sally Swain gives them their due, capturing them at their many household chores. 42 color illustrations.</p><p>"Why don't art galleries display more images of modern woman's daily domestic grind?" Forty-two color pictures elaborate on the above question and similar ones raised in this witty visual spoof of "great" art, i.e., art made by men according to male esthetics. Thus, a composition whose neat geometry recalls Mondrian demands a second look: the apparently abstract configuration depicts a robotic woman ("Mrs. Mondrian") wielding a mop. Another woman (with blood trickling from an amputated ear) makes the bed of Van Gogh's famously awry room. And in this Dejeuner sur l'herbe , the female picnickers wear business suits while a man reclines in abashed nudity. The jokes are pungent and readily accessible--no arcane allusions here. Several gags misfire: "Mrs. Pollock Can't Seem to Find Anything Any More" (the image of a woman tearing her hair is embedded in blithely swirling strokes of color) obscures the historical "Mrs. Pollock," the noted painter Lee Krasner. Swain, an Australian, is a self-taught artist and illustrator. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Official Price Guide to Costume Jewelry, 3rd edition</h2><p>Originally created as an alternative for those who could not afford the real thing, costume jewelry has become a collectible as desirable as fine jewelry. <b>The Official Price Guide to Costume Jewelry</b> covers every phase, fad, and style.

I read this book back in the early 1990's &amp; it is just the best. i still have my copy &amp; reread it once a year. Still makes me chuckle. I am now ordering a few more copies, for my football friends. It's a cross country (in a car) interview with Bill Curry (Center for Green Bay) &amp; George Plimpton. Includes an interlude with Sandy Kofax, among other game athletic stars. (Interesting &amp; funny read!) This is at least one of my all time favorite books, if not my favorite!! Do not miss, if you love football.</p><p></p><h2>Q is for Quilt</h2><p>Important Note about PRINT ON DEMAND Editions: You are purchasing a print on demand edition of this book.

That book has been cannibalized more times and has made more money for everybody save its author than he, that is, I, would care to count.In his book <i>Keith Richards, The Biography</i> (Poseidon Press, first edition 1992) Victor Bockris tells us that Richards was born on the 18th and 19th of December 1943 (pages 16 and 295; the error was subsequently corrected). For the sake of Keith's mother, born Doris Dupree thirty-three years before the birth of her only child, one hopes December 18 is the correct date.That <i>soi-disant</i> protracted delivery took place at Livingstone Hospital in the London suburb of Dartford, Kent. Dartford lies fifteen miles to the east and slightly south of London on the way to Canterbury, an easy first stop for London pilgrims. Dartford has been inhabited since the Stone Age; Julius Caesar, following a battle nearby, decided to leave Kent and return to Gaul, and royalty has visited the town many times. Isabella, sister of Henry III,was married by proxy to the Emperor Frederick II of Germany in Dartford Church in 1235. Edward III held a tournament in Dartford in 1331 and later founded there the Dominican Priory. In 1415 Henry V passed through the town on his return from Agincourt, and in 1422, his body rested in the Parish Church on its way to Westminster Abbey. During the Wars of the Roses (1452), Richard of York camped on the Brent and later surrendered to Henry VI at Dartford.In Tudor times, Henry VIII built a manor house on the site of the Priory and there for some years lived the Lady Anne of Cleves after her divorce. Here, too, Elizabeth "slept at her own house at Dartford," in 1573.Somehow these visits from royalty did not manage to impart to Dartford the same patina of fashion, elegance, and ease that Cheltenham--Rolling Stone Brian Jones's hometown and another hangout for royals-is considered by many to have. Dartford is just a London suburb rather than a center of vacation landscape, and almost as regularly as there were royal visits there were rebellions. Dartford is closely associated with the Wat Tyler Rebellion of English peasants against the young (fourteen) and inexperienced King Richard II in 1381. (And against most of the clergy, nobles, gentry, ministers, judges, lawyers, foreigners, and anyone who could write a letter-all these were to be killed.) During this civil disturbance, Dartford featured as the rallying point for the rebels on two occasions, and a John Tyler of Dartford is supposed to have killed one of the government tax-collectors. Wat Tyler paid the ultimate price for his rudeness, being dispatched by the scimitar of stalwart John Standwich, one of the king's squires. The other rebel leaders, they who had, accordingto the medieval historian Walsingham, "punished by beheading each and all who were acquainted with the laws of the country," were themselves executed, their severed heads displayed on London Bridge.During the reign of Mary Tudor, Dartford was one of the many places where martyrs suffered for conscience' sake. The stake was set up at Dartford Brent, about three-quarters of a mile out of the town, along Watling Street. There, on July 17, 1555, Christopher Wade was burned as a heretic; the memory of the Kent martyrs is perpetuated by a monument erected in the old burial ground on East Hill, which was the site of an ancient chapel of St. Edmund the Martyr and a place of pilgrimage in pre-Reformation times. In this reign too, two Dartford men-Robert Rudston and Thomas Fane-became involved in the Wyatt Rebellion and were imprisoned in the Tower of London, where the inscriptions they carved may still be seen. Through the years, Dartford's legacy has been unrest.During the English Civil War, the Lady Chapel in the Parish Church, which in 1642 had been converted into a powder magazine, was seized by the Kentish Royalists. At the time of the Restoration, Charles II passed through Dartford on his way to London. Stagecoaches started to run to Canterbury in 1670, and by 1815, seventy-two coaches were passing through the town every day. From a population of 2,406 in 1801, Dartford has grown to include over seventy thousand citizens. Its industries include cement manufacture, quarrying chalk, and papermaking; J. &amp; E. Hall of Dartford is the world's foremost manufacturer of refrigeration plants for cargo ships, and Dartford is also an important center for the manufactureof drugs, zinc oxide, and fireworks. Almost the same percentage (one-tenth) of land in Dartford as in Cheltenham is devoted to parks and open spaces, but in Dartford most of the open spaces are playing fields, rather than flower gardens.Few buildings of historical interest remain in Dartford, at least partly because of its having earned the name "Doodlebug Alley," after the German flying bombs during World War II. It was also called "The Graveyard."&nbsp;<br>Typically, Keith Richards, the ultimate rock 'n' roll survivor, who has been described as looking like an unresur-rected Christ, remembers heroic occurrences from his early youth that didn't exactly happen."Even if I'm walking down a hotel corridor," he told me, "and somebody as I'm passing their room has the TV on, and it's playing one of those blitz movies, English war movies, and I hear that siren, there is nothing I can do about it. The hair goes up on the back of my head and I get goose bumps. It's a reaction, something that I picked up from what happened in the first eighteen months of my life, from other people that really knew what was going on. My old man was in the army, and my ma took me out shopping for an hour or two and a VI, you know, the doodlebug ... we came back and the house was destroyed, it landed right on my crib. Adolf was on my tail. The bastard was after me. I went up the road to my auntie's, 'cause we lived on the same street."The facts are less dramatic: The house was damaged but not destroyed, and it happened after Keith and his mother had been evacuated (an appropriate verb to describe the early activities of an artist never blind to thecloacal vision) to Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, where thirty-seven-year-old Bert Richards--Keith's father, his leg wounded in Normandy--was in hospital. ("Boris and Dirt," Keith gave as his parents' names to a credulous fan mag.) The V1 raids lasted only two and a half months, and then Keith and his mother did go to stay with his aunt. "We went up there," Keith said, "and lived with my aunt for the rest of the war, which was like for another nine months, this happened late '44. After the war was over--my first memory actually is looking up in the sky and sort of pointing up and my mom saying, 'It's a Spitfire.'"After that I guess the memories start when I was three or four years old. I remember London, seeing these huge areas of rubble and grass growing and absolutely nothing. Dartford then was a very small town. You were on the edge of London but there was still plenty of space; you didn't actually feel part of London even though you were. When I was growing up, in those few years, if you went one way you went straight into the country and if you went towards London then you'd be in the suburbs in five or ten minutes. Dartford is a few miles from the Thames; all that's between Dartford and the river is just marshland. Which nobody has ever been able to do much with. We used to go down to the river when we were kids and play in these machine-gun bunkers and that was our playground, where weirdo hoboes would be living. Bums living in the marshes, and guys with shotguns. As I say, in Dartford you either go that way or you go in, and Dartford is one of those places where a lot of guys go out, they don't go in. No authority, none at all, just be the weirdest people living down there."The other reason that nobody would ever go near it was that ... right on the river from Dartford, which I lived close to, this marshland, is the smallpox hospital ... the plague joints. Built and left there, just in case an epidemic or something breaks out, lepers and ... mud flats ... . The Thames--the river's how you find out how to get to London from the air, it's easy to spot. It's like 'This way.' But it's not very habitable land, so it's like five gunpowder factories, armament factories; they make fireworks in peacetime, if it's wartime, they're just makin' powder. There's power stations and cement works on the horizon and nothing else except geese, little streams, marshes, marshland."&nbsp;<br>In 1954, with his family, the eleven-year-old Mick Jagger--who would become Keith Richards's songwriting collaborator and fellow band member in the Rolling Stones-moved to Wilmington, just outside Dartford in Southeast London. The year before, Keith Richards, six months Mick's junior, had come with his mother and father to live in a Dartford council estate that Keith would later characterize as "soul-destroying.""When I met Mick," Keith said, "I was living on the other side of town to where we eventually ended up. I first met Mick in 1949 or 1950, if not a little earlier. We went to our first school together at five, and he used to live around the corner from me, so we used to run into each other on our tricycles, and hang around here and there."Rationing lasted until 1954, so World War Two went on for people of my generation for another nine years after it finished everywhere else. That's when finally the candy came off rationing. When you're a kid growing up,that's the big thing. You can get more than one little bag a week, if you've got the bread, suddenly you can buy as much as you want. I remember when I first went to school, for months and months you got a bottle of concentrated orange juice--that was the only time you saw it--against the scurvy. Used to come in medicine bottles in England; you'd get them from the school medical services."Untypically, Keith, who would become famous as the soul of rebellion, of rock 'n' roll, spent his early adolescent years as a ball boy (Bert played tennis) and a choir boy. "Every weekend that the weather was nice--I had no choice, you know," Keith explains. "It was just a little two-court tennis court in Sidcup, where I ended up going to art school. About ten miles from home, I could ride a bike. Nice bunch of people, cricket club across the way. That's what I did on the weekends. We'd be there and if they had some competition and they needed ball boys, I would play ball boy. From seven, eight until ... thirteen, fourteen, fifteen."As a choir boy, Keith said, "I used to wear the cassock and everything, the whole bit. I can even remember the choirmaster's name, Jake Clair. But at that age, twelve or thirteen ... you're gonna sing, it's just a trip out; but you find out later on that you actually sang for the Queen in the Royal Festival Hall, Westminster Abbey. All my gigs since have gone right downhill. I forgot about it for thirty years, but me and two other guys did soprano, just a trio; the three of us did a whole trip down the aisle at Westminster Abbey, I guess it was about 1956 or 1957. We were the three worst kids, the worst hoods in the school in our own ways. But we had these three angelic voices. And JakeClair had been working on us for a couple of years by then; you'd get taken on the bus with the choir, to compete with this school and that school, and what I didn't realize until very recently was how good that guy must have been to get this little suburban choir into places like that. To us it was a way of getting out of chemistry and physics classes; if you were in the choir, you could get out of doing some of the more boring subjects."I had been in that choir two or three years, and once the voice broke there was no choir. So suddenly you're thrown back into the full curriculum and at first I was sort of resentful, being thrown out of the choir. Jake Clair had to be hard. I'm sure it broke his heart in many ways because the sopranos only last so long when they're boys ... . If you've got a soprano and he's eighteen years old, baby, he's got a problem. At the same time, it was the first time, like, 'We'll call you.' And so, immediately, the next year I fucked up royally. I was resentful, I had to do all this shit that I'd managed to get out of. So then they sent me to art school."In art school there's a very free atmosphere, you could walk into the John to take a pee and there would be three guys sitting around playing the guitar. They'd skip life class and they're doing like Woody Guthrie and Jack Elliott stuff. I didn't learn much about art in art school, but I did learn a lot about guitar playing. 'Cause then ... in the john you get the underground. You get into 'Talkin' New York Blues,' 'Mule Skinner Blues,' and 'Cocaine' -the song, not the stuff at the time. I was getting very interested in the blues, doing the Big Bill Broonzy, Muddy Waters stuff through listening to these cats play,and listening to like Jessie Fuller, twelve-string stuff, 'Sta-golee.'"&nbsp;<br>The strongest influence from Keith's family was his grandfather. "Gus--Augustus Theodore Dupree-was me mother's father. My granddad's name was DuPree because they were French, but they were protestant French and they got blown out and so they moved to the channel islands, the islands between England and France, and they came from there to England. He was a musician, a guy who could do anything, just about. If he can't do it, give him somebody to talk to and he'll talk him into doing it. He had seven daughters, and obviously he was living with the wife, so he's in a house full of eight women. It's enough to drive any guy balmy, that ... . And the only way around that is a sense of humor, which he had an abundance of."My aunts and uncles told me about the things he got up to when they started getting to the dating age. With seven daughters there were like four boyfriends around the front steps at once, and Gus would put a fucking used rubber on a piece of string and dangle it from an upstairs window so all the boys would see it--anything to fox 'em. He was one of the great dirty old men--I'm still trying to figure him out. See, when you know your family ... it's usually after they're dead and gone that you start to really appreciate them and suss out all the ramifications that they were trying to lay on you. At the time, 'There's Granddad and he's my granddad and I'm gonna do what he says.' Then you start to understand, they're fuckin' gurus. Just your granddad, or dad, or your auntie, they canteach this shit and they'll do it in a way ... they know what they're doing. You don't realize what it is they've done. I still sit here realizing things that my grandfather did. Just startin' to cotton on to the angle that he laid on me ... ."He was a saxophone player, also a master baker, and in the First World War he got gassed, chlorine shit, and after that he couldn't work in a bakery or play the sax anymore. The lungs were gone. So he took up the fiddle and guitar and piano, he used to have bands in the thirties. Later on, in the fifties, he played American G.I. bases in England, with a sort of western swing band, real hokey shit really, 'Turkey in the Straw,' good enough for the fifties."When I'd go to visit him, first off he'd feed me, then I'd just look at this guitar. I always thought it lived on top of the piano. In actua..."The interesting thing about music to me is that music has always seemed streaks ahead of any other art form of social expression."--Keith Richards<br><br>"A close-up look at the hard-driving, passionate musician who was once a choirboy and a convict."--<i>Playboy</i><br><br>"If there's one truth about the Rolling Stones, it's that people tend to die around them. Stanley Booth, God bless him, has lived to tell about it . . . <i>Keith </i>emerges quietly as the portrait of a specific kind of artist--a hard-working, record-mad, true musician."--Sarah Vowell<br><br>"Stanley Booth's new bio, <i>Keith, </i>is pretty close to a Stones demythology. Booth gets out of the way and lets the guitarist tell it."--<i>Puncture Magazine</i><br><br>"Booth has crafted a worthy adjunct to his own <i>True Adventures of the Rolling Stones</i> (easily the best chronicle of the band), weaving a tale that's one part straight rock bio and one part Richards-centric view of the rock universe."--<i>Request Magazine</i><br><br>"Booth cuts through the Dionysian thickets of Richards' adult life as gracefully as a blue highway through the Mississippi backwoods. . . . Booth lovingly details forays into the relationship between the artist and his music that are more than just illuminating; they're X-rays that expose the true heart of rock 'n' roll."--David Sprague<br></p><h2>Married to Africa: A Love Story</h2><p>G. Pascal Zachary is a foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal when he finds love in, of all places, the zoo in Accra, Ghana. That is where he meets Chizo Okon, the surrogate mother for an orphaned chimpanzee. In Married to Africa, Zachary tells their warm and humorous story, which is as much about the marriage of two cultures as it is about the marriage of two people. Chizo introduces Zachary to an Africa usually overlooked by visitors. He learns about the spiritual fervor of ordinary Africans, the mysterious power of juju and the rewards of eating bushmeat and other African dishes. He learns how to haggle effectively, pick a reliable taxi driver, live on &#34;Africa time&#34; and adapt to being a white minority in a black society. Chizo, meanwhile, deftly adapts to living with her obruni, the local nickname for a white person. As their romance deepens, the couple learns how differently things can appear to them. While Zachary indulges a passion for traditional African art, Chizo wo</p><p>G. Pascal Zachary&nbsp;is a professor of practice at Arizona State University, where he teaches on the history and future of innovation, technological change and science in society.&nbsp;<i>Endless Frontier&nbsp;</i>won the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers&#x2019; first literary award. He is also the author of&nbsp;<i>Showstopper,</i>&nbsp;on the making of a software program, and&nbsp;<i>The Diversity Advantage:&nbsp;Multicultural&nbsp;Identity in the New World Economy.</i><i>Chapter One</i> <p> Winter Loves Her </p><p> </p><p> Listening to my tales of youthful winters in New York did not prepare Chizo for her first encounter with intense cold. We are in the Sierra Nevada, walking on the edge of Lake Tahoe, the south end, on the border of California and Nevada, with all those tacky hotels and casinos. It is January and the snow is heavy. Chizo wears a pair of brown sheepskin boots and thick socks. Her feet are still cold. Her eyes peek out of a furry hood, her petite body encased in a wool sweater, a down jacket and an ankle-length coat. We are holding hands, as well as two people wearing thick gloves can. </p><p> I lead her out onto the frozen lake, explaining that there is water underneath this ice, telling her that in spring the lake thaws and becomes flowing water again. I tell her how, as a boy, I skated on a frozen lake. I tell her how people fish on frozen lakes, cutting holes into the ice, sending down their hooks. I tell her how the surface of a frozen lake can sometimes crack without warning, swallowing up anyone standing on the surface. I tell her we need not be worried now because it is too cold for the ice to crack. </p><p> We move farther onto the hard ice, farther from the safety of the shore. </p><p> My wife does not believe there is water underneath the ice, and I cannot convince her. I am accustomed to her skepticism after more than a year in America together. In West Africa, where we met and fell in love, our life together seemed solid. When I faced something I didn't understand, she was there to help guide me. I owe her. </p><p> For a long time in West Africa, she was my talking dictionary, a walking omnibus of cultural knowledge, my own personal Africa encyclopedia. She was not bashful either, often intervening to stop me from making a grievous mistake in my dealings with Africans. Chizo's cultural knowledge was part of her appeal to me because, without a trusted guide in a foreign land, a visitor can be lost. In exchange for her help, I felt an obligation to comprehend the ways of her people, as best I could, treating what I didn't understand with respect and sympathy, at least at first. </p><p> Chizo does not always display a similar tolerant attitude toward others, not in America anyway. Here I am not her talking dictionary. I am not her encyclopedia of America. When my country bewilders her, her first reaction is to question the sanity of Americans, just as she now questions whether we actually are walking on a sheet of ice or I am playing a trick on her. </p><p> "There is no lake here," she insists. "Don't lie to me. We walk on land, you trickish devil." </p><p> I do not lightly listen to Chizo invoke the devil. I answer by retreating from the ice, moving us back onto the lakeside, where there is solid ground beneath the hard snow. The sound of snow crunching under our feet makes Chizo smile. Her eyes light up. Her full lips are red and wet. Her dark skin is luminous even in the cold. </p><p> I reach down for a handful of snow, retreating from Chizo until I reach a suitable firing distance of about fifteen feet. Then I throw a snowball at her. I strike her leg and throw again, barely missing her head. The next one hits her in the chest. She bends down and tosses a ball of snow at me, the first snowball of her life. She misses me. I bend, grab snow and throw back, hitting her. Keeping my distance, I toss again, only now Chizo charges at me, on the attack, hitting me with snow, high and low, coming closer, until she is right on top of me and the snow is flying. </p><p> I am frozen in place, my feet sunk deep into the snow. I am defenseless. I cry for mercy and she ignores me, laughing. "This is your snow," she says. "I have mastered it more than you." </p><p> From a few feet away, she throws snowballs into my face. I am close enough to see the thrill in her eyes. The snowballs batter me and I sink to the cold ground, surrendering. Now I regret ever starting this snowball fight. To protect my face, I curl up in the fetal position. The snow rains on my back. Chizo is triumphant. "I am master of your American snow," she cries. </p><p> I laugh out even though I am angry over the pummeling I've received. Chizo is too fast, too powerful for me. I have learned not to roughhouse with her, but on this snow-covered ground, in the middle of winter, I felt emboldened to challenge her. She proved me to be foolish. I rise to my feet and snap a picture of her, standing tall, an African in winter, her first time seeing snow and already the queen of it. </p><p> She brushes the snow from my face and beard. I start to complain and she kisses me. "You made good on your promise," she says, reminding me how in Africa I promised to show her snow someday. </p><p> I am reminded now why I risked spoiling our love affair by bringing her to America: why we decided to endure the inevitable misunderstandings and cultural collisions that occur between two people who grew up in completely different places and who remain, no matter the intensity of our shared feelings, such strangers to one another that marriage is at times one long cultural trip wire that we keep setting off. </p><p> I decided to endure all of this so she could experience snow. </p><p> </p><p> We walk up the hill to where people are sledding. The hill crests at about two hundred feet and slopes down to the lakeside, making a perfect spot for sledding. The air is still, the sky is clear. We can see for miles across the lake and to the mountains in the distance. Below us people are sledding. We watch them for some time until Chizo decides to borrow a plastic sled from another visitor. The sled is circular, the size of a garbage-pail top. Chizo sits inside the top and steadies herself. She looks down the slope and out onto the frozen lake. I hold the edge of her sled, steadying her. About a dozen people are sledding now, stretched out across some fifty yards. She waits for the people on either side of her to launch and then finish their rides. Then she says she is ready and I gently push her sled and she flies off, screaming as she barrels down the slope. </p><p> Midway to the bottom, she steers past a rock, then soars into the air, coming down hard. She's still in the sled, still hurtling downhill. I'm relieved and let out a breath. I try to capture her with my camera but she is too far away even for my zoom. I can see only the bundle of her clothing. She glides another thirty feet, slowing, slowing, then stops. </p><p> When she gets to her feet she waves to me. She returns to the top of the hill and sleds down again. She avoids the rocks once more, reaching the bottom still on the sled, her journey drawing to a close. After three more trips, she returns the sled to its owner and waits to borrow another. The next sled is as long as her body and has a short rope with which to steer. She looks like she's in a bathtub and her ride this time is more impressive. Cutting sharply over the snow, she spills from the sled halfway down and climbs back to the top, wanting to try again. The next time, she gets all the way down the slope, riding like an experienced sledder. Watching her performance, I am proud of her. She is a natural, a marvel, a force of nature. When she returns to the top, she says, "I love winter." </p><p> And winter loves her. </p><p> </p><p> We retreat to our motel room, gaining relief from the cold. Outside our door, long icicles hang from the roof, and I go out and crack off two of them and return to the room. I hold the icicles like daggers while Chizo stands next to the wall heater, naked, warming herself. I run one of the icicles along the hollow of her back and then down her leg. She jumps and grabs one of the daggers. As I kiss the back of her elegant neck, she pretends to plunge the icicle into my side. We have a series of brief icicle fights, the ending always the same: Chizo stabs me. </p><p> I hand her my icicle, flip on the TV and begin to watch an NFL playoff game. Chizo can't stop talking about sledding, and I mute the TV and listen to her. </p><p> "It's scary," she says. "Oh god. It's scary, horrible. Unless you are a man with a heart, like people who go to war. They don't care about death and life. That's how it looks to me. Oh god. It looks like I'm facing dead. Talk less of when you are seeing those holes. Your mind is flying. It's like seeing a big accident face-to-face. You're dying in that moment." </p><p> She pauses, turning away from the heater, warming her back while staring at me. "I screamed to help me strong my heart," she says. "I can't be quiet, because I feel I'm facing my dying. I feel a giant of ice is ready to swallow me." </p><p> When she's finished describing her experience sledding, she pronounces the name "Tahoe" with her Nigerian accent, turning one word into two, as if she is saying "Ta" and "Hoe." I am always unconsciously translating her brand of English into my brand of English; the task is second nature to me now, so that I'm usually surprised when people tell me they struggle at first to understand Chizo's English. I no longer do. Her words have a certain poetry to me and I take delight in listening to her speak. </p><p> She asks me to get more icicles and I find even longer ones this time, so long that Chizo asks how they are formed. Having not lived in wintry climates for many years, I am fuzzy on the details. "Icicles are a mystery to me," I say. "Just enjoy them." </p><p> I go back to watching the football game. I lie in bed, facing the TV. She lies down next to me, curling up against my body. We are both under the covers now. She has yet to figure out the rules of football; though the game makes no sense to her, she doesn't object to me watching.

In an astonishingly honest, comic, and moving account of his tour of duty in Vietnam, master storyteller Tracy Kidder writes for the first time about himself. This extraordinary memoir is destined to become a classic.<br><br>Kidder was an ROTC intelligence officer, just months out of college and expecting a stateside assignment, when his orders arrived for Vietnam. There, lovesick, anxious, and melancholic, he tried to assume command of his detachment, a ragtag band of eight more-or-less ungovernable men charged with reporting on enemy radio locations. <br><br>He eventually learned not only to lead them but to laugh and drink with them as they shared the boredom, pointlessness, and fear of war. Together, they sought a ghostly enemy, homing in on radio transmissions and funneling intelligence gathered by others. Kidder realized that he would spend his time in Vietnam listening in on battle but never actually experiencing it. <br><br>With remarkable clarity and with great detachment, Kidder looks back at himself from across three and a half decades, confessing how, as a young lieutenant, he sought to borrow from the tragedy around him and to imagine himself a romantic hero. Unrelentingly honest, rueful, and revealing, <b>My Detachment</b><i> </i>gives us war without heroism, while preserving those rare moments of redeeming grace in the midst of lunacy and danger. The officers and men of <b>My Detachment</b> are not the sort of people who appear in war movies&#x2013;they are the ones who appear only in war, and they are unforgettable.</p><p>Tracy Kidder graduated from Harvard and studied at the University of Iowa. He has won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the Robert F. Kennedy Award, and many other literary prizes. The author of Mountains Beyond Mountains, Home Town, Old Friends, Among Schoolchildren, House, and The Soul of a New Machine, Kidder lives in Massachusetts and Maine.Chapter 1 <br>War Stories II<br><br> I am the author of Ivory Fields, a novel. I wrote it soon after I came home from Vietnam. Not many have read the book. After thirty-three publishers turned it down, I lit a fire in a trash barrel behind a rented house in Iowa and burned up all my copies of the manuscript. Years and years went by, and the book became a part of my distant memories of being a soldier, memories that would creep up on me when I was washing dishes or turning a key in a lock, memories that I wished away. Then one morning another copy of the novel arrived in the mail, from an old friend who was cleaning out his files, and I realized I was glad to have it back. From time to time I look at it, and I think. The protagonist of Ivory Fields is a strange, doomed young Army officer named Larry Dempsey. He's a second lieutenant, just as I was when I arrived in Vietnam in June 1968. But Lieutenant Dempsey is sent to Vietnam to lead an infantry platoon in combat. Whereas I commanded, in a manner of speaking, a detachment of eight enlisted men who performed an indoor sort of job, a classified mission called communications intelligence, in support of the 198th Light Infantry Brigade of the Americal Division. We belonged to the Army Security Agency, but in Vietnam we worked under the false though actually more descriptive name Radio Research. <br> I imagine this disguise was meant to confuse not only our enemies but also our friends who didn't have proper security clearances, but I don't know what difference it made. Our compounds were off limits to most American soldiers, and we never saw the Vietcong or North Vietnamese. At higher headquarters in Chu Lai and in small airplanes, other radio research soldiers listened in on the enemy's encrypted Morse code communications, and what they learned mainly locations was passed to my detachment, and passed on by me to the brigade commander. I remember an article in an overseas edition of Time that accurately described what units like ours were doing. I read the article in my hootch, in my detachment's compound, which was tucked inside the brigade's fortified base camp, Landing Zone Bayonet. The camp was situated at the edge of the coastal plain, at the base of the foothills of the central highlands, in the part of South Vietnam that the American authorities had labeled I Corps. I spent most of my year at lz Bayonet, inside the perimeter. <br>I remember watching a small group of American soldiers head out one evening. The selections that memory makes often puzzle me, but I probably remember seeing the patrol because it was the closest I ever got to the infantry in Vietnam. I was standing on the hill near my detachment�s antennas. I could see most of the base camp and to the west, out beyond the bunkers and barbed wire, green hills with taller hills like a wall behind them, and on a rock face in white paint, alpha 1�46 the gunfighters, the name of an infantry company that must have passed through in the course of the war and left that memento behind. The sun was setting on the hilltops, below great-chested clouds, and I was gazing out that way, glad to be apart from my men for a while, when I caught sight of the infantry patrol on one of the intervening hills, a group of olive-drab figures in procession, tiny at that distance, humpbacked beneath rucksacks. It would be dark soon. They were trudging away from the camp at an hour when I would have wanted to be heading in the opposite direction, toward hootches and beer and cots and mosquito nets and generators. <br> I had decided that this war was wrong. Not because of anything I had read recently or because of what I had seen so far. I opposed the war mainly because a lot of my friends were protesting against it back home. I watched the patrol with morbid fascination, with something like the feeling I used to get as a boy when I'd inch toward the edge of the roof of my grandmother's apartment building in New York, until the soldiers went over the hill in single file and disappeared. I was glad I wasn't going with them. But what if I had to? What if I enraged some field grade officer and for punishment got reassigned to the infantry? A fluttery sensation passed through my chest, and for a moment my hands felt weak. I imagined my civilian friends watching me. I imagined my girlfriend, Mary Anne. She might approve of my being less than gung ho, but not homesick and frightened. I had let some of those feelings slip into a few letters, and she had written me a sweet but keep-your-chin-up letter, in which she'd said, "Don't be so paranoid. I'd be more careful from now on. Soon my letters would suggest a stoical, even at times heroic young fellow. And after all, here I was, standing on the edge of the dangerous highlands under an operatic Asian sky, in a situation she ought to find poignant, a reluctant commander drawing hazardous duty pay. <br> I wandered down the hill, past our latrine, toward the enlisted men's hootches, and turned in at the one we had made into our lounge. Outside the screen door, I heard beer cans hissing open. I went inside as usual. Five or six of my men were sitting around the tv set, awaiting that evening�s episode of Combat! The title filled the screen: What Are the Bugles Blowin For? Sergeant Saunders's platoon has volunteered for a dangerous mission, which takes them, through the pouring rain, into a bombed-out village in France. The one kid left in the village joins up with them. He wants to fight the Krauts, too, because they killed his sister. He wants to get the man who did it, so he keeps checking the faces of the Krauts that Sergeant Saunders's squad guns down. Sergeant Saunders is brave and wise, and kind to children and women, especially nuns. I had a good sergeant, a buck sergeant in his early twenties, three stripes on the sleeves. His name was Stoney Spikes, and he came from Alabama. He had a strong face, with a big square chin, and the other men obeyed him. He kept one of his two pairs of jungle boots polished more or less, for the inspections we occasionally endured, which were for me almost a form of combat. The other pair he left unshined, at first perhaps because he saw no sense in shining them and later on, I think, because they made him feel more like the soldier he wished he was because a real soldier, an infantryman, a grunt, would never wear shiny boots in the bush. Spikes had gone away on leave and had run into some buck sergeants his age who had Combat Infantryman's Badges. "They got a name for people like us, Lieutenant," he told me when he came back. His jaw hardened. The term was remf. It stood for "Rear Echelon Mother Fucker." Spikes never seemed quite the same after he found out what real soldiers thought of soldiers like us.<br> In my memory, he sits forever in the lounge, at the end of another hot and dusty day. He opens a beer and tells the other men to hush as Combat! fills the tv screen, and he is dressed for the show in those sad, scuffed jungle boots. In a sense, I put on scuffed boots too, when I came home and began to write my novel about an infantry platoon and its lieutenant. Writing about experiences that I didn't have in Vietnam quieted real memories. A decade later, I had become a magazine writer. In 1978, still curious about those experiences that I had merely imagined, I traveled around the country, interviewing Vietnam combat veterans, to gather material for an article. And what a lot of strange and violent experience had been transported back into the United States, into jails and treatment centers and at least as often into houses on quiet, tree-lined streets. I met a former infantryman who remembered getting a black eye when a piece of his best friend's skull hit him in the face, a former combat medic who had finally weaned himself from morphine but still had lurid dreams about the men whose lives he hadn't saved, a government official who had lost an arm and both legs to a hand grenade, and dozens of others with terrible stories, all certifiable. Also, in Louisville, Kentucky, I met a man whom I'll call Bill, who told me a different kind of story, a tale about a tale. <br> In a bar one night, after listening to a bunch of other Vietnam veterans tell war stories, Bill had said, "We were ridin' on an apc outside Pleiku, when we got hit." Bill had told the barroom that he could still see those tracer rounds, like little red-tailed comets coming at them from the tree line, and the way his buddy who was sitting beside him on the armored personnel carrier slumped over and, as if in slow motion, fell by the side of the trail. Bill was scared, he told the bar. Fuckin' A, who wouldn't be? But that was his buddy, that was a GI lying wounded and dying back there on the trail. The captain, though, was yelling at the driver to di di mao. And Bill was yelling at the captain that they had to go back, and the coward told him to shut up and shouted at the driver again to move out. So afterward, back in base camp, the captain, to cover his ass, busted Bill to spec. 4, and Bill brooded and brooded and finally made up his mind to get payback. He had to kill the officer. He had to frag the lifer. Bill was sitting on a sofa in his parents' living room when he described himself telling that story. He said that he really did experience some moments of near combat in Vietnam, and that there really was a captain he wanted to kill, who busted him in rank. And in fact, Bill came home wounded. But his actual offense was repeated drunkenness, and he got his wound when he fell in a hole in a base camp and a friend, also stumbling drunk, fell in on top of him and broke his jaw. Bill had come home feeling miserable and had moved between the city's drunk tank and its barrooms, where he told his story again and again. It just came out one time, and it felt really good. Then each time I'd say it, I'd make it a little more glorified, Bill told me. "When I came home, the other veterans always had big wild stories, and I didn�t have anything like theirs to tell. And theirs was probably as fictitious as mine. He looked down at his hands and seemed to smile a...</p><h2>Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker: Traveller and Plant Colle</h2><p>Sir Joseph Hooker is remembered as an eminent Victorian botanist and one of Charles Darwin&#39;s closest collaborators. Many gardeners and lovers of rhododendrons know of his plant collecting expedition in the Himalayas, but few are aware of his participation in Sir James Clark Ross&#39; epic voyage to Antarctica in 1839-43, of his visits to Syria and Lebanon in 1860, to the Atlas Mountains in Morocco in 1871, and to the Rockies and California in 1877. At some risk to his own safety and health (he came close to drowning in the Antarctic Ocean and was imprisoned by the Rajah of Sikkim), he discovered many new species of plants and introduced a number of attractive flowers into British gardens. When Hooker encountered European species growing in the southern hemisphere he naturally wondered how they got there. He shared his theories on plant distribution and other topics of mutual interest with Darwin to whom he also sent scientific data acquired during his travels.

Hodge, with his rigid doctrine of biblical inerrancy, and Bushnell, with his open-ended experiential theology, represent two poles of thought that continually assert themselves when American Protestants speak out on social issues. This book provides a case study in the moral implications of each of these enduring polarities and upsets conventional understandings of the relationship of conservative and liberal Protestantism to slavery and race. The ambivalent attitudes of both men toward slavery and race are significant aspects of both of their enduring intellectual legacies. This is the first book-length comparison of these two theologians on this subject.</p><p></p><h2>My Soul&#39;s Been Psychedelicized: Electric Factory: Four Decades in Posters and Photographs</h2><p><p><b>Philadelphia's popular music scene and the concert promoters who shaped it for more than forty years</b></p></p><p><p>On February 2, 1968, the Electric Factory, Philadelphia's first major venue for the era's new music, opened with a show featuring the Chambers Brothers.

By means of an analysis of specific texts - for example, those that deal with the Sabbath and the Festivals - Knohl demonstrates the existence of two separate priestly sources, loosely connected with what we have known as P and the Holiness Code. The "Holiness School" is shown to be active subsequent to that of the Priestly Torah and, in fact, to be responsible for the great enterprise of editing the Torah.<br>Knohl examines the conceptions of divinity and ritual reflected in priestly thought and legislation in ancient Israel and the changes revealed in these conceptions over time. The Priesthood appears as an elite, closeted within the walls of the "Sanctuary of Silence," drawn toward the hidden, noble divinity ensconced within its shrine. The later stratum of Priestly writings expresses a desire to transcend the limits of the temple and go out into the broad avenues of the nation, even at the price of surrendering the loftiness of earlier faith and practice.<br>The conclusion describes the changes that occurred in the Priests' worldview as an attempt to come to terms with the socio-religious crisis that had brought about a disjunction between ritual and ethics. In response to this crisis, the priests developed a wider conception of holiness, one that integrates ethics and ritual in one sphere.</p><p>Israel Krohl is Lecturer in the Department of Bible at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Hebrew</p><h2>The Kingdom Revealed (The Invisible Kingdom Trilogy)</h2><p><p>A stunningly illustrated fairytale for all ages from internationally-acclaimed papercut artist rob ryan the follow-up to <i>The Invisible Kingdom</i>.</p><br><br><p>This is a story about a young boy who doesn t want to be King.

She lives in northern California.<br>Readers with a craving for supernatural romance will not find much satisfaction in this dry and predictable tale. Though outwardly a well-adjusted teenager, Molly suffers from severe hydrophobia and is plagued by an eerie recurring dream; both these conditions are aggravated when Jared, her love-interest-to-be, throws her into a swimming pool and she nearly drowns. Then Molly arrives to spend the summer in the small Maine town where her father and new stepmother have recently set up house, and things go from bad to worse. Not only does the ever-persistent Jared show up, but the strangely familiar town itself brings on a series of rather tepid waking visions in which Molly believes herself to be Clementine, a shallowly depicted and unpleasant girl who lived at the turn of the century. With the help of her New Age stepmother, Molly comes to realize what most readers will have guessed long before: somehow, possibly through reincarnation, Molly and Jared are connected to the lives of two long-dead young people. Given that the characters are invested with no more than a single dimension, not even the triple prospect of dramatic coastal storms, paranormal flashbacks and Jared's earthly kisses is enough to enliven this plodding story.

This island chain lay in the main line of the American advance eastward. The Pacific High Command saw the conquering of this chain as a necessary prelude to General Douglas MacArthur's long-awaited liberation of the Philippines.<br><br>Of all the Palaus, Peleliu, the second southernmost, was the most strategically valuable. It boasted a large flat airfield located on a relatively low plain at its southern end. If it was taken, it could be used as a major airbase from which the Americans could mount a massive bomber campaign against the Philippines if needed, and eventually against Japanese home islands. Except for the airfield, Peleliu was a typical humid tropical island, covered by dense jungle and swamps, with many coconut, mango, and palm tree groves.<br><br>The main amphibious assault was to be made by the famed First Marine Division under the command of Major General William Rupertus. The Pacific High Command was confident that victory would be theirs in just a few days, convinced that the Japanese defending the island were relatively weak and underprepared.<br><br>They were drastically wrong. The Peleliu campaign took two and a half months of hard bitter fighting, and just a week after landing, having sustained terrific losses in fierce combat, Chesty Puller&#x2019;s 1st Marine Regiment was withdrawn. The entire division would be out of action for six months, with the three rifle regiments averaging over 50% casualties - the highest unit losses in Marine Corps history. <br><br>This book analyzes in detail the many things that went wrong to make these casualties so excessive, and in doing so, corrects several earlier accounts of the campaign. It includes a comprehensive account of the presidential summit that determined the operation, details of how new weapons were deployed, a new enemy strategy, and command failure in what became the most controversial amphibious operation in the Pacific during WWII.<br></p><p>Peter Margaritis minored in History at Ohio State University.

In this he covers such matters as shortages of large caliber naval munitions, poor reconnaissance, inadequate intelligence, limited tactical radio range, and even the pressures generated by the rapidly accelerating Allied success against Japan. Not neglecting the other side of the hill, he examines the revision of Japanese defensive tactics from suicidal banzai counter-attacks to tenacious resistance in well sited and constructed fortifications. Margaritis closes with a chapter on the aftermath of the battle.

For two centuries her warriors were acknowledged as second to none. Yet at only one period in its long history, in the late fourth and early third century BC, did the home of these grim warriors seem set to entrench itself as the dominant power in the Greek world. This period includes the latter stages of the Peloponnesian War from 412 BC to the Spartan victory in 402, and then down to the Spartan defeat by the Thebans at Leuctra in 371 BC, where it all began to unravel for the Spartan Empire<br> <br>Surprisingly few previous books have covered the tumultuous first decades of the fourth century BC, particularly when compared to the ample coverage of the Peloponnesian War. As the authors explain, although the earlier period has the benefit of Thucydides' magisterial history, the period covered here is actually well served by sources and well worthy of study. There are many interesting characters here, including Alcibiades, Lysander, Agesilaus, Pelopidas and Epaminondas, to name but a few.

Why have cinema and photography been so drawn to each other? Close-ups, freeze frames and the countless portrayals of photographers on screen are signs of cinema&#x2019;s enduring attraction to the still image.

J.B. Priestley famously described the &#39;three Englands&#39; he saw in the 1930s: Old England, nineteenth-century England and the new, post-war England. Thirties Britain was, indeed, a land of contrasts, at once a nation rendered hopeless by the Depression, unemployment and international tensions, yet also a place of complacent suburban home-owners with a baby Austin in every garage. Now Juliet Gardiner, acclaimed author of the award-winning Wartime, provides a fresh perspective on that restless, uncertain, ambitious decade, bringing the complex experience of thirties Britain alive through newspapers, magazines, memoirs, letters and diaries. Gardiner captures the essence of a people part-mesmerised by &#39;modernism&#39; in architecture, art and the proliferation of &#39;dream palaces&#39;, by the cult of fitness and fresh air, the obsession with speed, the growth and regimentation of leisure, the democratisation of the countryside, the celebration of elegance, glamour and sensation. Yet, at the same time, this was a nation imbued with a pervasive awareness of loss - of Britain&#39;s influence in the world, of accepted political, social and cultural signposts, and finally of peace itself.</p><p>Juliet Gardiner is a respected commentator on British social history from the Victorian times through to the 1950s. She was Editor of History Today magazine and is also the author of the critically acclaimed and bestselling `Wartime&#39;.`The cinematic clarity of Gardiner&#39;s descriptions of accidents and ceremonies tells more about the decade than a page of statistics....or the depth of its research, the quality of the writing and the sheer richness and vibrancy of the material, this is a quite outstanding work of social history&#39; Telegraph `It is comfortably the definitive account of a decade that has been much maligned&#39; Daily Telegraph `A definitive, vividly detailed book on a complex decade, which is a joy to read&#39; History Today</p><h2>Fast and Fun First Quilts: 18 Projects for Instant Gratification</h2><p><p>Sara Diepersloot, author of the popular <i>Simple Style</i>, presents 18 exciting new patterns in one small volume--a terrific value.

Noyes, is a personal and emotional account, in words and pictures, of the effect of Western contact on the Hawaiian population. Drawing from a variety of sources, Noyes chronicles the effects, from the arrival of Capt. Cook to the present, of disease, written language, the missionaries, landownership, the overthrow of the monarchy, and the suppression of hula and Hawaiian language, concluding with a look at present-day activism.

No doubt, some thoughts he expressed would have been impossible to reaffirm five years later. As we commemorate the centenary of terrible and unprecedented conflict, his intelligent voice from the past gives us an insight into how people thought before it and what was lost. This does not mean that Mitchell&#39;s ideas are not also an individual&#39;s, but it is now the combination of freshness and distance in this previously unpublished prose that makes it so compelling.</p><p>Thomas Mitchell, born in 1870, was a tenant farmer at Mill of Ardo, a small settlement in North-East Scotland, and his family had leased since 1791. He was clearly well-educated and his house was full of books. He went to school in Foveran and Cultercullen in Aberdeenshire until he was seventeen and he enrolled in further education courses well into his twenties. He took over the lease in 1890 when his uncle died. He lived with his mother and grandmother. He was a quiet man who went to the mart in Aberdeen on a Friday and church on a Sunday. He married Margaret Finnie late in life and only after the death of his mother in 1922, and had two children, William and Margaret. William too was in the mould of his father and combined a keen sense of history with service to the community and the church.

These "gilded girls" who performed in the mining boomtowns were literally showered with gold, but oftentimes their personal lives were marked by unhappiness. Still, their very presence on stage enchanted avid western audiences, and they were rewarded with flowery reviews and sensational editorials by local newspapers, as well as riches. Their every action was commented upon, but rarely did reporters know the whole story.

Not in the home of her mum, desperately drunk and poor. Not in the household of her wealthy granny, where no girl can be named an heir. And certainly not in the arms of Nat, her childhood love who never knew her for who she was. As a sailor aboard a Caribbean merchant ship, Mary&#x2019;s livelihood&#x2014;and her safety&#x2014;depends on her ability to disguise her gender. <br><br> At least, that&#x2019;s what she thinks is true. But then pirates attack the ship, and in the midst of the gang of cutthroats, Mary spots something she never could have imagined: a <i>girl</i> pirate. <br><br> The sight of a girl standing unafraid upon the deck, gun and sword in hand, changes everything. In a split-second decision, Mary turns her gun on her own captain, earning herself the chance to join the account and become a pirate alongside Calico Jack and Anne Bonny. <br><br> For the first time, Mary has a shot at freedom. But imagining living as her true self is easier, it seems, than actually doing it. And when Mary finds herself falling for the captain&#x2019;s mistress, she risks everything&#x2014;her childhood love, her place among the crew, and even her life. <br><br> Breathlessly romantic and brilliantly subversive, <i>The Unbinding of Mary Reade</i> is sure to sweep readers off their feet and make their hearts soar.</p><p><b>Miriam McNamara</b> earned a Master of Fine Arts in Writing for Children and Young Adults from the Vermont College of Fine Arts, where she won the Norma Fox Mazer award for a historical young adult manuscript work-in-progress. <i>The Unbinding of Mary Reade</i> is her first novel.

It is the culmination of thirty years of Tolstoy&#39;s Christian thinking, and lays out a new organization for society based on a literal Christian interpretation of the Bible. Here Tolstoy introduces the world to the concept of Christian non-violent resistance. A classic in modern Christian and Western thinking.</p><p>He is considered one of the greatest novelists in any language in all of human history, but Leo Tolstoy was also an influential social reformer and peace advocate. Subtitled "Christianity Not as a Mystical Teaching but as a New Concept of Life," this powerful exploration of the preachings of Jesus from a pacifistic perspective. First published in 1893, it introduced such important 20th-century figures as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King to the concept of nonviolent resistance. <p> This edition is vital reading for anyone wishing to understand the history of protest around the world or gain a deeper appreciation of pacifistic Christianity.</p>Nikolai Tolstoy is a highly recognized and acclaimed historian and biographer.

So too did Stephen Shore, who photographed the gardens one hundred years later after their painstaking restoration. Commissioned by The Metropolitan Museum of Art to photograph the renascence of the gardens, Shore visited Giverny over six years beginning in 1977. Going to the gardens before dawn and leaving after dusk, in different seasons, he came to know them in all the moods and textures that inspired Monet. Shore&#39;s fidelity to the gardens&#39; plenitude and his desire to present the abstract beauty of nature result in exquisitely serene photographs that express the essence of Giverny.</p><p><b>Stephen Shore</b> is currently the Chair of the Division of the Arts and the Susan Weber Soros Professor in the Arts at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. <br></p><h2>The Great Arab Conquests</h2><p>Today&#39;s Arab world was created at breathtaking speed. Whereas the Roman Empire took over 200 years to reach its fullest extent, the Arab armies overran the whole Middle East, North Africa and Spain within a generation. They annhilated the thousand-year-old Persian Empire and reduced the Byzantine Empire to little more than a city-state based around Constantinople. Within a hundred years of the Prophet&#39;s death, Muslim armies destroyed the Visigoth kingdom of Spain, and crossed the Pyrenees to occupy southern France. This is the first popular English language account of this astonishing remaking of the political and religious map of the world. Hugh Kennedy&#39;s sweeping narrative reveals how the arab armies conquered almost everything in their path. One of the few academic historians with a genuine talent for story telling, he offers a compelling mix of larger-than-life characters, battles, treachery and the clash of civilizations.</p><p>Hugh Kennedy studied Arabic at the Middle East Centre for Arabic Studies before reading Arabic, Persian and History at Cambridge. Since 1972 he has taught in the Department of Mediaeval History at the University of St. Andrews. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2000.In forthrightly popular style, Kennedy fascinatingly chronicles the expansion of Islam from the death of the Prophet Mohammed in 632 to the beginning of the Abbasid Caliphate in 750 (the latter the subject of Kennedy&#39;s When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World, 2005). Relating the story, however, requires care since most sources date, as Kennedy cautions, from 150 to 250 years after the conquests they purport to describe. Kennedy&#39;s warnings engage interest as he provides the contexts of late antiquity, which lent advantage to the new religion sweeping out of Arabia. Crucially, Near East populations had been devastated by plague and by a war between Islam&#39;s political enemies: the Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Empire of Persia. Kennedy&#39;s attention to these factors deepens his interpretations of the Islamic chronicles, which he describes as frustratingly vague on details of battles but strangely attentive to the division of booty. Explaining the �lan that propelled Islam so far, so fast, and so permanently, Kennedy vividly introduces the formative establishment of Islam.

The trouble is, he&#39;s not very good at it. All he wants is the usual three wishes: to be immortal, rule the world and have the most beautiful woman fall madly in love with him. The usual stuff. But what he gets is Rincewind, the Disc&#39;s most incompetent wizard, and Rincewind&#39;s Luggage (the world&#39;s most dangerous travel accessory) into the bargain. Terry Pratchett&#39;s hilarious take on the Faust legend stars many of the Discworld&#39;s most popular characters in an outrageous adventure that will leave Eric wishing once more - this time, quite fervently, that he&#39;d never been born.</p><p>Terry Pratchett&#39;s Discworld series is a publishing phenomenon. He was knighted in the 2009 New Year Honours; previously he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to literature in 1998. He has been awarded six honorary doctorates, and has won the Carnegie Medal and the Michael Prinz Award. He lives near Salisbury in Wiltshire.The latest in Pratchett's Discworld series plays a variation on the Faust theme. Eric is a singularly inept sorcerer who conjures up an even more inept wizard, Rincewind, and a sentient (also treacherous, vindictive, and unruly) footlocker named, of course, the Luggage. Not having got anything like what he bargained for, Eric is fated to go through the usual zany ordeals of a Pratchett protagonist, until he wishes he'd never been born. Nor do things really all work out in the end, even if Eric is better off than he expected to be through most of the book. The Discworld books are building a following that is beginning to resemble that of Piers Anthony's Xanth stories, although it can be said that Pratchett is rather more sophisticated than Anthony. In any case, there should be a lot of readers for this one. Fantasy collections, provide accordingly. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>A Christmas Grace: A Novel</h2><p>When the season brings a chill, nothing warms the heart or elevates the spirits like a new novel by Anne Perry, whom the Chicago Sun-Times calls &#x201c;the most adroit sleight-of-hand practitioner since Agatha Christe.&#x201d; Perry&#x2019;s gifts are on full display in A Christmas Grace&#x2013;a hope-filled tale of forgiveness that is rich with mystery and intrigue.<br><br>With Christmas just around the corner, Thomas Pitt&#x2019;s sister-in-law, Emily Radley, is suddenly called from London to be with her dying aunt. Leaving her husband and two children behind, Emily makes the long journey to an all-but-forgotten town in the county of Connemara, on the western coast of Ireland. She soon discovers that a tragic legacy haunts the once closeknit community. <br><br>Violent storms ravage the coast and keep alive painful memories of an unsolved murder and unsettling fears that a killer may still live among the residents of the lonely Irish town. Determined to lighten her aunt&#x2019;s heart and help the troubled community, Emily sets out to unmask the culprit. When a lone shipwreck survivor washes up onshore, he brings with him not only the key to solving the terrible crime but the opportunity for the townspeople to make peace with the past&#x2013;and with one another.</p><p>Anne Perry is the bestselling author of five earlier holiday novels&#x2013;A Christmas Journey, A Christmas Visitor, A Christmas Guest, A Christmas Secret, and A Christmas Beginning&#x2013;as well as the William Monk series and the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series set in Victorian England, and five World War I novels. Anne Perry lives in Scotland.Emily Radley stood in the center of her magnificent drawing room and considered where she should have the Christmas tree placed so that it would show to the best advantage. The decorations were already planned: the bows, the colored balls, the tinsel, the little glass icicles, and the red and green shiny birds. At the foot would be the brightly wrapped presents for her husband and children.<br><br>All through the house there would be candles, wreaths and garlands of holly and ivy. There would be bowls of crystallized fruit and porcelain dishes of nuts, jugs of mulled wine, plates of mince pies, roasted chestnuts, and, of course, great fires in the hearths with apple logs to burn with a sweet smell.<br><br>The year of 1895 had not been an easy one, and she was happy enough to see it come to a close. Because they were staying in London, rather than going to the country, there would be parties, and dinners, including the Duchess of Warwick&#x2019;s; everyone she knew would be at that dinner. And there would be balls where they would dance all night. She had her gown chosen: the palest possible green, embroidered with gold. And, of course, there was the theater. It would not be the same without anything of Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s, but there would be Goldsmith&#x2019;s She Stoops to Conquer, and that was fun.<br><br>She was still thinking about it when Jack came in. He looked a little tired, but he had the same easy grace of manner as always. He was holding a letter in his hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Post?&#x201d; she asked in surprise. &#x201c;At this time in the evening?&#x201d; Her heart sank. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not some government matter, is it? They can&#x2019;t want you now. It&#x2019;s less than three weeks till Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for you,&#x201d; he replied, holding it out for her. &#x201c;It was just delivered. I think it&#x2019;s Thomas&#x2019;s handwriting.&#x201d;<br><br>Thomas Pitt was Emily&#x2019;s brother-in-law, a policeman. Her sister, Charlotte, had married considerably beneath her. She had not regretted it for a day, even if it had cost her the social and financial comforts she had been accustomed to. On the contrary, it was Emily who envied Charlotte the opportunities she had been given to involve herself in some of his cases. It seemed like far too long since Emily had shared an adventure, the danger, the emotion, the anger, and the pity. Somehow she felt less alive for it.<br><br>She tore open the envelope and read the paper inside.<br><br>Dear Emily,<br><br>I am very sorry to tell you that Charlotte received a letter today from a Roman Catholic priest, Father Tyndale, who lives in a small village in the Connemara region of Western Ireland. He is the pastor to Susannah Ross, your father&#x2019;s younger sister. She is now widowed again, and Father Tyndale says she is very ill. In fact this will certainly be her last Christmas.<br><br>I know she parted from the family in less than happy circumstances, but we should not allow her to be alone at such a time. Your mother is in Italy, and unfortunately Charlotte has a bad case of bronchitis, which is why I am writing to ask you if you will go to Ireland to be with Susannah. I realize it is a great sacrifice, but there is no one else.<br><br>Father Tyndale says it cannot be for long, and you would be most welcome in Susannah&#x2019;s home. If you write back to him at the enclosed address, he will meet you at the Galway station from whichever train you say. Please make it within a day or two. There is little time to hesitate.<br><br>I thank you in advance, and Charlotte sends her love.

What does he say?&#x201d;<br><br>Wordlessly she passed the letter to him.<br><br>He read it, frowning, and then offered it back to her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I know you were looking forward to Christmas at home, but there&#x2019;ll be another one next year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going!&#x201d; she said incredulously.<br><br>He said nothing, just looked at her steadily.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s ridiculous,&#x201d; she protested. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go to Connemara, for heaven&#x2019;s sake. Especially not at Christmas. It&#x2019;ll be like the end of the world. In fact it is the end of the world. Jack, it&#x2019;s nothing but freezing bog.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually I believe the west coast of Ireland is quite temperate,&#x201d; he corrected her. &#x201c;But wet, of course,&#x201d; he added with a smile.<br><br>She breathed out a sigh of relief. His smile could still charm her more than she wished him to know. If he did, he might be impossible to manage at all. She turned away to put the letter on the table. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll write to Thomas tomorrow and explain to him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What will you say?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>She was surprised. &#x201c;That it&#x2019;s out of the question, of course. But I&#x2019;ll put it nicely.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How nicely can you say that you&#x2019;ll let your aunt die alone at Christmas because you don&#x2019;t fancy the Irish climate?&#x201d; he asked, his voice surprisingly gentle, considering the words.<br><br>Emily froze. She turned back to look at him, and knew that in spite of the smile, he meant exactly what he had said. &#x201c;Do you really want me to go away to Ireland for the entire Christmas?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Susannah&#x2019;s only fifty. She might live for ages. He doesn&#x2019;t even say what&#x2019;s wrong with her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One can die at any age,&#x201d; Jack pointed out. &#x201c;And what I would like has nothing to do with what is right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about the children?&#x201d; Emily played the trump card. &#x201c;What will they think if I leave them for Christmas? It is a time when families should be together.&#x201d; She smiled back at him.<br><br>&#x201c;Then write and tell your aunt to die alone because you want to be with your family,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;On second thoughts, you&#x2019;ll have to tell the priest, and he can tell her.&#x201d;<br><br>The appalling realization hit her. &#x201c;You want me to go!&#x201d; she accused him.</p><h2>Woman and nature: The roaring inside her</h2><p>In this famously provocative cornerstone of feminist literature, Susan Griffin explores the identification of women with the earth-both as sustenance for humanity and as victim of male rage. Starting from Plato&#39;s fateful division of the world into spirit and matter, her analysis of how patriarchal Western philosophy and religion have used language and science to bolster their power over both women and nature is brilliant and persuasive, coming alive in poetic prose. Griffin draws on an astonishing range of sources-from timbering manuals to medical texts to Scripture and classical literature-in showing how destructive has been the impulse to disembody the human soul, and how the long separated might once more be rejoined. Poet Adrienne Rich calls Woman and Nature &#34;perhaps the most extraordinary nonfiction work to have merged from the matrix of contemporary female consciousness-a fusion of patriarchal science, ecology, female history and feminism, written by a poet who has created a new form for her vision. ...The book has the impact of a great film or a fresco; yet it is intimately personal, touching to the quick of woman&#39;s experience.&#34;</p><p>"<b>Woman and Nature</b> is about memory and mutilation, female anger as power, female presence as transforming force. . . . Griffin has collected here the most apparently disparate materials [from lumbering manuals to poetry to gynecology texts] into an extraordinary collage which, for all the research and hard intellectual work underlying it, becomes an intense physical experience."<br>-- Adrienne Rich<br><br>"My journey through the strange and familiar worlds of <b>Woman and Nature</b> has been strengthening and enspiriting. It is a book which I will read and re-read, assign to classes, give to friends. It is a work of great and daring vision."<br>-- Mary Daly<br><br>"<b>Woman and Nature</b> is my favorite -- in my opinion the best -- feminist book of the past twenty-five years.

FromRuby's struggle to rise above her leukemia and her father's love of severeweather and killing tornadoes, to the saint who witnesses a miracle at thebottom of a drowned Spanish village.</p><p>Set against the backdrop of some of the most significant Olympic moments ofour times--the Nazis' stylish and sinister glorification of the Berlin Olympicsand the 1972 Munich hostage--taking in which 11 Israelis were murdered--<em>Olympia</em>offers a bold and refreshing perspective on the tragic relationship betweenGermans and Jews in this century.</p><p>Bock writes with insight and clarity in a breath-taking, beautiful prose thatsignals the debut of a brilliant new talent.</p></p><p><i>Olympia</i> tells the story of three generations quietly grappling with the emotional fallout of war. There are the grandparents, Lottie and Rudolph, who met while competing in the 1936 Berlin Olympics; their son and his wife, who emigrated from Germany after World War II; and the grandchildren--Peter, who narrates, and his sister Ruby, both Canadian-born children of the '70s. Into this portrait Bock skillfully splices imaginary outtakes from Leni Riefenstahl's film of the 1936 Olympics, <i>The Olympiad</i>. The result is a layered album of family stories and a moving meditation on the intersection of memory, identity, and the past. <p> Early on we discover that this family is Lutheran, not Jewish--and that Bock is tackling the uneasy question of what it means to be German in this century. He avoids generalizations about guilt or complicity in the war, aiming for something more delicate, more murky. "It seemed that everyone my parents knew back then had escaped to this country from that dark place ... after the war had ended," Peter explains. "But it took me until that summer to find out that there were things I hadn't been told, that there were secrets in my house." </p><p> Bock focuses with understated precision on the private moments of victory and defeat that make up the subjective history of a family: Ruby's fight against leukemia and her dream to succeed as an Olympic gymnast; a failed reunion between Peter's mother and the brother she hasn't seen since the end of the war; the deaths of the grandparents; a father and son's shared obsession with storms. Elliptical, nuanced, affirming, and sad, <i>Olympia</i> is a masterful examination of how a family embodies and survives its legacy. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p><p>DENNIS BOCK'S first book of stories, <em>Olympia</em>, won the 1998 Canadian Authors Association Jubilee Award, the Danuta Gleed Award for best first collection of stories by a Canadian author and the British Betty Trask Award.

They give you the power to convey everything from realistic light and shadow to dynamic mood and tension.</p><p>Mark Christopher Weber shows you how to mix and load paint, shape your brush and apply a variety of intriguing strokes in nine easy-to-follow demonstrations. Special icons appear throughout the book to indicate which brush to use for each technique and when. It couldn't be any easier.</p></p><p>Mark Christopher Weber is an award-winning artist whose work appears in many corporate collections including Shell Oil, Marathon Oil, Grand Canyon Association and the Federal Reserve Building. He is also represented in galleries in California, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, Utah and Japan. Mark lives in Kansas City, Missouri.Weber spells out the fundamental differences between smooth brushwork and the calm mood it can impart, and the rough texture of a scumbled or thickly painted surface expressing an energetic aura. Photographs show the exact premise behind each of Weber's lessons, from what the paint looks like when you vary the consistency with mediums or solvents, to mixing with a brush or cleaning your brushes to best maintain them. Illustrations are followed by images of finished paintings, reinforcing the specific points discussed. Weber writes with humor and confidence, keeping things lighthearted whether he is teaching the mechanics of holding a brush or a wet-into-wet application of paint on canvas. <i>Alice Joyce</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His early years were spent in Lancashire and Hampshire. He left school at sixteen to work as a local government clerk until being called up for army service in 1941, and spent the following four and a half years with the Royal Corps of Signals, in Gibraltar, North Africa, Italy, and Austria. </p><p> On leaving the army he renewed a teenage ambition toward being a writer, and in 1947, on the basis of an unfinished novel, won an Atlantic Award, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, which enabled him to devote himself to writing for a year. He tried to justify the award by writing serious novels, but subsequently also wrote detective thrillers, light comedies, novels based on cricket, and science fiction, to which he had been passionately devoted in his early teens. After several adult science fiction novels, he was asked to write for the young adult field, and ended up writing sixteen books in that genre, including <i>The Guardians, The Lotus Caves, Dom and Va, Empty World,</i> and the Sword and Fireball trilogies, as well as the Tripods trilogy. Following a BBC television series in 1984 based on the Tripods books, he wrote a prequel, <i>When the Tripods Came,</i> explaining how it all came about. </p><p> Sam Youd is a widower with five children and numerous grandchildren, and lives in Rye, in the county of Sussex, England.</p><p><br> Chapter One: Capping Day </p><p><br> Apart from the one in the church tower, there were five clocks in the village that kept reasonable time, and my father owned one of them. It stood on the mantelpiece in the parlor, and every night before he went to bed he took the key from a vase, and wound it up. Once a year the clockman came from Winchester, on an old jogging packhorse, to clean and oil it and put it right. Afterward he would drink camomile tea with my mother, and tell her the news of the city and what he had learned in the villages through which he had passed. My father, if he were not busy milling, would stalk out at this time, with some contemptuous remark about gossip; but later, in the evening, I would hear my mother passing the stories on to him. He did not show much enthusiasm, but he listened to them. </p><p> My father's great treasure, though, was not the clock, but the Watch. This, a miniature clock with a dial less than an inch across and a circlet permitting it to be worn on the wrist, was kept in a locked drawer of his desk; and only brought out to be worn on ceremonial occasions, like Harvest Festival, or a Capping. The clockman was only allowed to see to it every third year, and at such times my father stood by, watching him as he worked. There was no other Watch in the village, nor in any of the villages round about. The clockman said there were a number in Winchester, but none as fine as this. I wondered if he said it to please my father, who certainly showed pleasure in the hearing, but I believe it truly was of very good workmanship. The body of the Watch was of a steel much superior to anything they could make at the forge in Alton, and the works inside were a wonder of intricacy and skill. On the front was printed "Anti-magnetique Incabloc," which we supposed must have been the name of the craftsman who made it in olden times. </p><p> The clockman had visited us the week before, and I had been permitted to look on for a time while he cleaned and oiled the Watch. The sight fascinated me, and after he had gone I found my thoughts running continually on this treasure, now locked away again in its drawer. I was, of course, forbidden to touch my father's desk and the notion of opening a locked drawer in it should have been unthinkable. Nonetheless, the idea persisted. And after a day or two, I admitted to myself that it was only the fear of being caught that prevented me. </p><p> On Saturday morning, I found myself alone in the house. My father was in the mill room, grinding, and the servants -- even Molly who normally did not leave the house during the day -- had been brought in to help. My mother was out visiting old Mrs. Ash, who was sick, and would be gone an hour at least. I had finished my homework, and there was nothing to stop my going out into the bright May morning and finding Jack. But what completely filled my mind was the thought that I had this opportunity to look at the Watch, with small chance of detection. </p><p> The key, I had observed, was kept with the other keys in a small box beside my father's bed. There were four, and the third one opened the drawer. I took out the Watch, and gazed at it. It was not going, but I knew one wound it and set the hands by means of the small knob at one side. If I were to wind it only a couple of turns it would run down quite soon -- just in case my father decided to look at it later in the day. I did this, and listened to its quiet rhythmic ticking. Then I set the hands by the clock. After that it only remained for me to slip it on my wrist. Even notched to the first hole, the leather strap was loose; but I was wearing the Watch. </p><p> Having achieved what I had thought was an ultimate ambition, I found, as I think is often the case, that there remained something more. To wear it was a triumph, but to be seen wearing it...I had told my cousin, Jack Leeper, that I would meet him that morning, in the old ruins at the end of the village. Jack, who was nearly a year older than myself and due to be presented at the next Capping, was the person, next to my parents, that I most admired. To take the Watch out of the house was to add enormity to disobedience, but having already gone so far, it was easier to contemplate it. My mind made up, I was determined to waste none of the precious time I had. I opened the front door, stuck the hand with the Watch deep into my trouser pocket, and ran off down the street. </p><p> The village lay at a crossroads, with the road in which our house stood running alongside the river (this giving power for the mill, of course) and the second road crossing it at the ford. Beside the ford stood a small wooden bridge for foot travelers, and I pelted across, noticing that the river was higher than usual from the spring rains. My Aunt Lucy was approaching the bridge as I left it at the far end. She called a greeting to me, and I called back, having first taken care to veer to the other side of the road. The baker's shop was there, with trays of buns and cakes set out, and it was reasonable that I should be heading that way: I had a couple of pennies in my pocket. But I ran on past it, and did not slacken to a walk until I had reached the point where the houses thinned out and at last ended. </p><p> The ruins were a hundred yards farther on. On one side of the road lay Spiller's meadow, with cows grazing, but on my side there was a thorn hedge, and a potato field beyond. I passed a gap in the hedge, not looking in my concentration on what I was going to show Jack, and was startled a moment later by a shout from behind me. I recognized the voice as Henry Parker's. </p><p> Henry, like Jack, was a cousin of mine -- my name is Will Parker -- but, unlike Jack, no friend. (I had several cousins in the village: people did not usually travel far to marry.) He was a month younger than I, but taller and heavier, and we had hated each other as long as I could remember. When it came to fighting, as it very often did, I was outmatched physically, and had to rely on agility and quickness if I were not going to be beaten. From Jack I had learned some skill in wrestling which, in the past year, had enabled me to hold my own more, and in our last encounter I had thrown him heavily enough to wind him and leave him gasping for breath. But for wrestling one needed the use of both hands. I thrust my left hand deeper into the pocket and, not answering his call, ran on toward the ruins. </p><p> He was closer than I had thought, though, and he pounded after me, yelling threats. I put a spurt on, looked back to see how much of a lead I had, and found myself slipping on a patch of mud. (Cobbles were laid inside the village, but out here the road was in its usual poor condition, aggravated by the rains.) I fought desperately to keep my footing, but would not, until it was too late, bring out my other hand to help balance myself. As a result, I went slithering and sprawling and finally fell. Before I could recover, Henry was kneeling across me, holding the back of my head with his hand and pushing my face down into the mud. </p><p> This activity would normally have kept him happy for some time, but he found something of greater interest. I had instinctively used both hands to protect myself as I fell, and he saw the Watch on my wrist. In a moment he had wrenched it off, and stood up to examine it. I scrambled to my feet, and made a grab, but he held it easily above his head and out of my reach. </p><p> I said, panting, "Give that back!" </p><p> "It's not yours," he said. "It's your father's." </p><p> I was in agony in case the Watch had been damaged, broken maybe, in my fall, but even so I attempted to get my leg between his, to drop him. He parried, and, stepping back, said, </p><p> "Keep your distance." He braced himself, as though preparing to throw a stone. "Or I'll see how far I can fling it." </p><p> "If you do," I said, "you'll get a whipping for it." </p><p> There was a grin on his fleshy face. "So will you. And your father lays on heavier than mine does. I'll tell you what: I'll borrow it for a while. Maybe I'll let you have it back this afternoon. Or tomorrow." </p><p> "Someone will see you with it." </p><p> He grinned again. "I'll risk that." </p><p> I made a grab at him, I had decided that he was bluffing about throwing it away. I almost got him off balance, but not quite. We swayed and struggled, and then crashed together and rolled down into the ditch by the side of the road. There was some water in it, but we went on fighting, even after a voice challenged us from above. Jack -- for it was he who had called to us to get up -- had to come down and pull us apart by force. This was not difficult for him. He was as big as Henry, and tremendously strong also. He dragged us back up to the road, got to the root of the matter, took the Watch off Henry, and dismissed him with a clip across the back of the neck. </p><p> I said tearfully, "Is it all right?" </p><p> "I think so." He examined it, and handed it to me. "But you were a fool to bring it out." </p><p> "I wanted to show it to you." </p><p> "Not worth it," he said briefly. "Anyway, we'd better see about getting it back. I'll lend a hand." </p><p> Jack had always been around to a lend a hand, as long as I could remember. It was strange, I thought, as we walked toward the village, that in just over a week's time I would be on my own. The Capping would have taken place, and Jack would be a boy no longer. </p><p> Jack stood guard while I put the Watch back and returned the drawer key to the place where I had found it. I changed my wet and dirty trousers and shirt, and we retraced our steps to the ruins. No one knew what these buildings had once been, and I think one of the things that attracted us was a sign, printed on a chipped and rusted metal plate: </p><p><br> DANGER<br> 6,600 VOLTS </p><p><br> We had no idea what Volts had been, but the notion of danger, however far away and long ago, was exciting. There was more lettering, but for the most part the rust had destroyed it. lect city: we wondered if that were the city it had come from. </p><p> Farther along was the den Jack had made. One approached it through a crumbling arch; inside it was dry, and there was a place to build a fire. Jack had made one before coming out to look for me, and had skinned, cleaned, and skewered a rabbit ready for us to grill. There would be food in plenty at home -- the midday meal on a Saturday was always lavish -- but this did not prevent my looking forward greedily to roast rabbit with potatoes baked in the embers of the fire. Nor would it stop me doing justice to the steak pie my mother had in the oven. Although on the small side, I had a good appetite. </p><p> We watched and smelled the rabbit cooking in companionable silence. We could get on very well together without much conversation, though normally I had a ready tongue. Too ready, perhaps -- I knew that a lot of the trouble with Henry arose because I could not avoid trying to get a rise out of him whenever possible. </p><p> Jack was not much of a talker under any circumstances, but to my surprise, after a time he broke the silence. His talk was inconsequential at first, chatter about events that had taken place in the village, but I had the feeling that he was trying to get around to something else, something more important. Then he stopped, stared in silence for a second or two at the crisping carcass, and said, </p><p> "This place will be yours, after the Capping." </p><p> It was difficult to know what to say. I suppose if I had thought about it at all, I would have expected that he would pass the den on to me, but I had not thought about it. One did not think much about things connected with the Cappings, and certainly did not talk about them. For Jack, of all people, to do so was surprising, but what he said next was more surprising still. </p><p> "In a way," he said, "I almost hope it doesn't work. I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be a Vagrant." </p><p> I should say something about the Vagrants. Every village generally had a few -- at that time there were four in ours, as far as I knew -- but the number was constantly changing as some moved off and others took their place. They occasionally did a little work, but whether they did or not the village supported them. They lived in the Vagrant House, which in our case stood on the corner where the two roads crossed and was larger than all but a handful of houses (my father's being one). It could easily have accommodated a dozen Vagrants, and there had been times when there had been almost that many there. Food was supplied to them -- it was not luxurious, but adequate -- and a servant looked after the place. Other servants were sent to lend a hand when the House filled up. </p><p> What was known, though not discussed, was that the Vagrants were people for whom the Capping had proved a failure. They had Caps, as normal people did, but they were not working properly. If this were going to happen, it usually showed itself in the first day or two following a Capping: the person who had been Capped showed distress, which increased as the days went by, turning at last into a fever of the brain. In this state, they were clearly in much pain. Fortunately the crisis did not last long; fortunately also, it happened only rarely. The great majority of Cappings were entirely successful. I suppose only about one in twenty produced a Vagrant. </p><p> When he was well again, the Vagrant would start his wanderings. He, or she; because it happened occasionally with girls, although much more rarely. Whether it was because they saw themselves as being outside the community of normal people, or because the fever had left a permanent restlessness in them, I did not know. But off they would go and wander through the land, stopping a day here, as long as a month there, but always moving on. Their minds, certainly, had been affected. None of them could settle to a train of thought for long, and many had visions, and did strange things. </p><p> They were taken for granted, and looked after, but, like the Cappings, not much talked about. Children, generally, viewed them with suspicion and avoided them. They, for their part, mostly seemed melancholy, and did not talk much, even to each other. It was a great shock to hear Jack say he half wished to be a Vagrant, and I did not know how to answer him. But he did not seem to need a response. He said, "The Watch -- do you ever think what it must have been like in the days when things like that were made?" </p><p> I had, from time to time, but it was another subject on which speculation was not encouraged, and Jack had never talked in this way before. I said, "Before the Tripods?" </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "Well, we know it was the Black Age. There were too many people, and not enough food, so that people starved, and fought each other, and there were all kinds of sicknesses, and..." </p><p> "And things like the Watch were made -- by men, not the Tripods." </p><p> "We don't know that." </p><p> "Do you remember," he asked, "four years ago, when I went to stay with my Aunt Matilda?" </p><p> I remembered. She was his aunt, not mine, even though we were cousins: she had married a foreigner. Jack said, "She lives at Bishopstoke, on the other side of Winchester. I went out one day, walking, and I came to the sea. There were the ruins of a city that must have been twenty times as big as Win...</p></p><h2>Dien Bien Phu: The Epic Battle America Forgot (History of War)</h2><p><i>Dien Bien Phu</i> is the definitive account of the great, climactic battle in French Indochina that led to the American commitment to Vietnam. Defense analyst Howard R. Simpson was an eyewitness.</p><p>The late Howard R. Simpson was the author of eight other well-received novels. He also wrote several nonfiction books, including <i>Someone Else's War</i> and <i>Dien Bien Phu</i>The battle of Dien Bien Phu (1953-1954), stresses the author, was one of the modern era's most decisive confrontations. Simpson, who as a U.S. Information Agency correspondent visited the isolated French fortress and knew many of its defenders, relates the story in heroic terms: how General Giap's Viet Minh troops hauled artillery pieces across mountain ranges and through dense jungles to dominating heights overlooking Dien Bien Phu, their shells ultimately forcing the French surrender; the poignant call for volunteers willing to parachute into the besieged fort to reinforce the casualty-depleted garrison and the response by hundreds of men even though Dien Bien Phu was already doomed. The fall of the fort on May 7, 1954, after a 57-day siege was a disaster for France, for it spelled the end of French hegemony in Indochina and opened the way for U.S. involvement in the region. Simpson pointedly reviews the lessons that would be ignored by the Americans in their ensuing war with the NVA/VC: not to underestimate the guerrilla or overestimate U.S. air power, and above all to secure the support of domestic public opinion. Simpson ( Tiger in the Barbed Wire ) has written a military classic based on newly released documents, interviews with survivors, and his own vivid and compassionate recollections.

In his Crockford&#39;s Preface (1987-88), Gareth Bennett drew attention to a theology in retreat, pinpointing the crisis within Anglicanism as being fundamentally theological, and called for a return to our roots, our prescriptive sources, as the way out of the malaise of modern Anglicanism. Canon Middleton takes us back to these prescriptive sources, and shows us that Anglicanism has its own peculiar character, and one that still speaks to us today. Tracing that character in the Reformers, the Carolines, the Oxford Fathers and the Formularies, he shows that despite the discontinuities of their time these divines are aware of the continuity and wholeness of the Christian tradition in all its fullness, organic wholeness and unbroken unity. Continuity is for them a dynamic and living transmission of certain living qualities of faith and order, the Tradition the Church hands on. These prescriptive sources speak to us of an issue facing us that is far bigger than the saving of the Church of England; it is the saving of the Apostolic Faith and Order of the Church, for which Ignatius died. They point us in the way of the re-integration of the universal Church in east and west, to a western orthodoxy, that is free from the relativism of the present: such orthodox Christian faith comes in all its saving power to identify with the world, but refuses to be accommodated to it, because its authority lies in its bringing to bear on the world an insight more adequate than the world&#39;s own.

Green Boards with Gold Gilt Lettering on spine. A Grand Epic Fantasy Adventure with Jacket Art by Pauline Baynes.</p><p><i>Watership Down</i> has been a staple of high-school English classes for years. Despite the fact that it's often a hard sell at first (what teenager wouldn't cringe at the thought of 400-plus pages of talking rabbits?), Richard Adams's bunny-centric epic rarely fails to win the love and respect of anyone who reads it, regardless of age. Like most great novels, <i>Watership Down</i> is a rich story that can be read (and reread) on many different levels. The book is often praised as an allegory, with its analogs between human and rabbit culture (a fact sometimes used to goad skeptical teens, who resent the challenge that they won't "get" it, into reading it), but it's equally praiseworthy as just a corking good adventure.<p> The story follows a warren of Berkshire rabbits fleeing the destruction of their home by a land developer. As they search for a safe haven, skirting danger at every turn, we become acquainted with the band and its compelling culture and mythos. Adams has crafted a touching, involving world in the dirt and scrub of the English countryside, complete with its own folk history and language (the book comes with a "lapine" glossary, a guide to rabbitese). As much about freedom, ethics, and human nature as it is about a bunch of bunnies looking for a warm hidey-hole and some mates, <i>Watership Down</i> will continue to make the transition from classroom desk to bedside table for many generations to come. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Battle Of The Atlantic: How the Allies Won the War</h2><p>A gripping tale that transforms our understanding of the Second World War The Battle of the Atlantic was - though often overlooked - crucial to victory in the Second World War. If the German U-boats had prevailed, the maritime artery across the Atlantic would have been severed. Mass hunger would have consumed Britain, and the Allied armies would have been prevented from joining in the invasion of Europe. There would have been no D-Day. Through fascinating contemporary diaries and letters, from the leaders and from the sailors on all sides, Jonathan Dimbleby creates a thrilling narrative that uniquely places the campaign in the context of the entire Second World War. Challenging conventional wisdom on the use of intelligence and on Churchill&#39;s bombing campaign, The Battle of the Atlantic tells the epic story of the decisions that led to victory, and the horror and humanity of life on those perilous seas.</p><p>Jonathan Dimbleby is a writer, broadcaster and film-maker. He is the chairman of BBC Radio 4&#39;s weekly Any Questions? programme and presented ITV&#39;s flagship weekly political programme, This Week, for over ten years. He is also the author of Destiny in The Desert: The Road to El Alamein, which was followed by his BBC 2 programme Churchill&#39;s Desert War. Both were highly acclaimed. In 2008 his five-part series on Russia was broadcast by BBC 2, accompanied by his book, Russia: A Journey to the Heart of a Land and Its People. His other books include Richard Dimbleby: A Biography, The Palestinians, The Prince of Wales: A Biography and The Last Governor.This is an exceptionally vivid account of one of the critical campaigns of the Second World War by a masterly writer -- Max Hastings Winston Churchill famously described the Battle of the Atlantic as &#39;a war of groping and drowning, a war of ambuscade and stratagem, a war of science and seamanship&#39; and no book depicts all of those myriad aspects better than Jonathan Dimbleby&#39;s majestic overview. His judgments can sometimes be harsh and are bound to be controversial, but they are backed up with wide reading, diligent scholarship and cogent argument. This is a truly gripping account of a campaign that the author rightly puts epicentral to the Allied victory in the Second World War. * Andrew Roberts, author of &#39;Masters and Commanders&#39; * A fascinating story written with bite and grip of one of the most crucial showdowns of the twentieth century - of a victory wrung out of the unforgiving Atlantic swell by sailors and airmen using the best technology and Intelligence that those on land could provide. How close-run it was and the price of losing would have been catastrophe, defeat and darkness. Compelling -- Lord Peter Hennessy, author of &#39;The Silent Deep&#39; Jonathan Dimbleby&#39;s second volume on the Second World War is even better than its predecessor. The Battle of the Atlantic is a gripping account of the Allies&#39; hard-won victory at sea. Dimbleby has delivered a masterful narrative that challenges many of the received views about this often overlooked conflict that foretold the defeat of Nazism. -- Amanda Foreman Excellent on the characters of individual commanders . . . But perhaps the book&#39;s greatest strength is its analysis of the strategic side of the battle. Regularly switching from vivid coverage of individual encounters at sea, the narrative reveals the intense discussions that took place at the highest levels to decide naval policy, especially among Churchill, Roosevelt and their military advisers. It is [the] controversial assertion, backed by solid research and a readable style, that makes this book so compelling. -- Leo McKinstry * Wall Street Journal * Starred review. &#34;A gripping history overflowing with anecdotes and enough calamity, misery, explosions, and individual valor for a Hollywood disaster epic.&#34; * Kirkus * A gripping read and a great contribution to the history of the Second World War. The author realizes his immense ambition of bringing out the human aspects of the drama at every level, from the heads of state to the crews in the Atlantic, while also bringing important nuances to received views on the struggle against the U-boats, and, indeed, on Churchill&#39;s war leadership. An epic account. * Peter Padfield, author of &#39;War Beneath the Sea: Submarine Conflict 1939-1945&#39;, and biographies of Doenitz, Himmler and Hess * In this refreshing book Jonathan Dimbleby skilfully weaves together front line accounts and high policy discussions to provide a gripping and accessible new account of the most important campaign of the Second World War against Germany. * Professor Eric Grove, author of &#39;The Royal Navy since 1815&#39; * The epic Battle of the Atlantic can only really be understood when set against the strategic context of the time. This highly engaging history does this by combining gripping accounts of the tactics and operational fortunes of the Germans and the Allies in this bitterest of battles with an authoritative review of the strategic thinking that helps explain their motives and their responses at the highest national level, and that shows why victory was so important for both sides. * Professor Geoff Till, author of &#39;The Development of British Naval Thinking&#39; * Dimbleby makes a convincing case that of all the campaigns of WWII, the struggle for dominance over the North Atlantic was the most important . . . The history of the battle for the Atlantic is well documented, but Dimbleby&#39;s work, with its emphasis on the strategic importance of the battle, is an excellent addition to the story, and expert historians as well as general readers can enjoy this effort * Publishers Weekly * Dimbleby&#39;s incisive, gripping narrative uniquely places the campaign in the context of the entire war as it recounts the horror and humanity of life on those perilous oceans. -- Richard Blackmore * The Independent * The strength of the book is its vivid evocation of dramatic events -- Robert Tombs * The Times * The Battle of the Atlantic is a wonderfully readable mix of vivid personal stories and the penetrating questions that you wish someone had put to Churchill -- Bronwen Maddox, Editor-in-Chief of Prospect Magazine Dimbleby captures the savagery of the fighting and of the sea itself... he has tackled the complexities in a very accessible way; but more importantly he has woven a compelling narrative of the people who fought, directed and ultimately decided our fate -- Admiral Lord West I liked Jonathan Dimbleby&#39;s The Battle of the Atlantic and was gobsmacked to learn that the Germans read British radio messages much better than we read theirs. Air Ministry obstinacy (in failing to release aircraft from futile area bombing for anti-submarine patrols) nearly cost Britain the war -- Matt Ridley * Books of the Year 2015 * Fascinating * Richard and Judy * I am chilled to the bone and beyond ... the most extraordinary story ... absolutely fascinating -- Vanessa Feltz An accessible and anecdotal account of the battle and the men who waged it, full of colour and surprising detail -- Charlotte Heathcote * Daily Express * Fascinating, thought-provoking and entertaining. Explodes a number of self-serving myths * Andrew Roberts (on &#39;Destiny in the Desert: The Road to El Alamein&#39;) * Fresh and provocative * Peter Snow (on &#39;Destiny in the Desert&#39;) * A wonderfully incisive, superbly written history.

I try to flesh out her native landscape. I try to imagine what it would be like to have me as a mother&#34;. The experience of motherhood is an experience in contradiction. It is commonplace and it is impossible to imagine. It is prosaic and it is mysterious. It is at once banal, bizarre, compelling, tedious, comic and catastrophic. To become a mother is to become the chief actor in a drama of human existence to which no one turns up. It is the process by which an ordinary life is transformed unseen into a story of strange and powerful passions, of love and servitude, of confinement and compassion. In this work, novelist Rachel Cusk attempts to tell something of this story, an old story set in a new era of sexual equality. When we no longer know what it is to be a woman, what is it to be a mother? When our expectations are so complex, what can we make of the simple lowliness of caring for a small child? Cusk&#39;s story of a year of modern motherhood becomes many stories: a farewell to freedom, sleep and time; a lesson in humility and hard work; a journey to the roots of love; a meditation on madness and mortality; and most of all a sentimental education in babies, books, toddler groups, bad advice, crying, breastfeeding and never being alone.</p><p>Rachel Cusk is the author of three novels: SAVING AGNES, which won the Whitbread First Novel Award, THE TEMPORARY, and THE COUNTRY LIFE, which won a Somerset Maugham Award. This is her first work of non-fiction.&#39;As compulsive as a thriller. No mother could fail to be interested and moved.&#39; Kate Kellaway, Observer &#39;An incitement to riot. I laughed out loud, often, in painful recognition.&#39; Esther Freud &#39;Full of enormous insight and sly wit. Cusk has crafted a work of beauty and wisdom. And belly laughs.&#39; Suzanne Moore, New Statesman &#39;A deeply fascinating read, a nakedly honest, witty and eloquent exploration of the world of mother and child, where each of us began.&#39; Helen Dunmore &#39;A breath of fresh air. It took me back to raw emotions since edited from my official history. If I were still in the midst of it I expect I would seize on the book in the same frame of mind as Noah did his ark.&#39; Maureen Freely, Independent &#39;She observes her own sensations and transfers them, still bleeding, to the page where some alchemy of her prose renders this most fascinating and boring of all subjects graceful, eloquent, modest and true.&#39; Jane Shilling, Sunday Telegraph &#39;I read it in one sitting, completely mesmerized. Every line rang true. A stunning achievement.&#39; Madeleine Wickham &#39;Mothers are usually compelled to say, &#34;I love my children but&#34;. It is the &#34;but&#34; that Cusk bravely stresses.

Reaching down to pull it out, Brunetti&#39;s wrist is caught by the silkiness of golden hair, and he sees a small foot--together he and Vianello lift a dead girl from the water. But, inconceivably, no one has reported a missing child, nor the theft of the gold jewelry that she carries. So Brunetti is drawn into a search not only for the cause of her death, but also for her identity, her family, and for the secrets that people will keep in order to protect their children--be they innocent or guilty. The investigation takes Brunetti from the canals and palazzos of Venice to a Gypsy encampment on the mainland, through quicksands of connections and relationships both known and concealed, as he struggles with both institutional prejudice and entrenched criminality to try to unravel the fate of the dead child.</p><p>Amazon Best of the Month, May 2008: Reading <i>The Girl of His Dreams</i> leaves you no choice but to reconsider what makes a mystery novel so good. Certainly there's no denying the appeal of a hard-boiled crime story, where more often than not a brilliant yet battered P.I. drives you white-knuckled to the edge of your seat, but Donna Leon's Guido Brunetti--at once exactingly inquisitive and disarmingly sensitive--bucks that genre convention entirely. Here, in Leon's seventeenth Brunetti mystery, is a man who investigates the tragic drowning of a young Gypsy girl relentlessly, yet--in his thoughtful meanderings through the streets and cafes of Venice--also struggles to understand the human warps and weaknesses that make his beloved city so vulnerable. In the end, it's this pure love and curiosity for life (and, I admit, his lusty appreciation of daily luxuries like prosecco, good coffee, or a burst of sunshine) that make Brunetti such a seductive hero--so much so that you're willing to follow him wherever he goes. <i>--Anne Bartholomew</i><br><b>Narrator Information: David Colacci</b> has directed and performed in prominent theaters nationwide for the past thirty years.

She&#39;s the survivor... the last girl. Meet Cassie Hack, the lone survivor of an attack by a vicious slasher called The Lunch Lady. Now Cassie, along with her monstrous partner, Vlad, travel the country, hunting down other slashers before they can leave a trail of blood and terror.</p><p>Slashers are "Bad" because they're icky grotesques who hate people, especially horny teenagers, and like to butcher them. On the other hand, cute goth Cassie Hack and her huge, deformed partner, Vlad, must be "Good" because they go around the country killing slashers in various messy ways. Cassie, last survivor of the Lunch Lady killings, is aware enough of genre conventions to make sarcastic comments as she does her thing, but action is pretty standard. Seeley's scripts are efficient enough, and Caselli and Manfredi's dark, dark art gets the job done. In "Comic Book Carnage," set at a commercial comics convention, Cassie and Vlad really do get involved with their surroundings; for the first time, the supporting characters become slightly more than slasher-movie stereotypes, so that it matters somewhat whether they live or die. The question is whether writers and artists in a book like this can get past awareness that they're essentially doing a variation on <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> and go on to do fresh, original work. Based on the amount of development shown here, the answer is a firm, confident maybe. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the introduction to his book George Kennan tells us, "I came to see World War I . . . as the great seminal catastrophe of this century--the event which . . . lay at the heart of the failure and decline of this Western civilization." But, he asks, who could help being struck by the contrast between this apocalyptic result and the "delirious euphoria" of the crowds on the streets of Europe at the outbreak of war in 1914! "Were we not," he suggests, "in the face of some monstrous miscalculation--some pervasive failure to read correctly the outward indicators of one's own situation?" It is from this perspective that Mr. Kennan launches a "micro-history" of the Franco-Russian relationship as far back as the 1870s in an effort to determine the motives that led people "to wander so blindly" into the horrors of the First World War.</p></p><p><b>George F. Kennan</b> (1904 -2005) was the U.S. Ambassador to Russia and Yugoslavia, and professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. He is the author of many books, including <i>Soviet-American Relations, 1917-1920</i> (two volumes) and <i>From Plague After Munich: Diplomatic Papers, 1938-1940 </i>(both from Princeton)."Mr. Kennan takes full advantage of the colorful opportunities that the Franco-Russian romance presents. He has not only advanced our knowledge significantly by impressive research; he presents his results with great skill; he writes beautifully, harmoniously, and vividly. He is at his best when revealing how human frailties played havoc with national interests."<b>---Theodore Zeldin, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>"The world which George Kennan describes with great elegance and skill and with much lively atmospheric detail is the world of traditional nineteenth-century diplomacy. . . . The great achievement of George Kennan's book is that he uses his scholarship and his extensive knowledge of the large body of secondary literature on the Franco-Russian Alliance to remind us how high diplomacy of the late nineteenth century looked to contemporaries."<b>---James Joll, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>"This is a serious historical volume, but the people it involves, those who influenced or controlled Franco-Russian relations from 1875 to 1890, are . . . a most astonishing set of zanies, scalawags, and fanatics, all vividly characterized by Mr. Kennan." (<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>)<br><br>"Our former Ambassador to Russia and Yugoslavia brings to this study the attributes of a seasoned diplomat, historian, and linguist. With admirable clarity and fluency, Kennan . . . untangles the skein of European and Balkan politics of the late 1800s . . . and traces the rise of nationalism and militarism which led to W.W.I." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)</p><h2>Elvis Presley: A Life in Music--The Complete Recording Sessions</h2><p>For the first time, the complete story of Elvis Presley's recording career is told in this remarkable book. With exclusive access to the RCA vaults, producer Ernst Jorgensen brings to intimate life every moment that Elvis spent in the studio--from the spontaneous joy of his early sessions to the intensely creative periods of his later career. At once the definitive recording session guide and a compellingly readable narrative, this is the ultimate companion to the singer and his songs.<br></p><p>Ernst Jorgensen produced many RCA Elvis box sets, for which he was nominated for a Grammy Award. He lives in Denmark.<br>As director of RCA's Elvis catalogue, Jorgensen is one of the key figures behind the Elvis Presley CD box sets RCA has issued in recent years. This book makes a worthy companion to those historic releases. All of the King's known recordings?including rehearsals, live recordings and recordings made in the privacy of his hotel rooms?are approached with the same reverence that his studio sessions inspire, providing a framework for a narrative of Elvis's life. Indeed, eminent Presley biographer Guralnik (Last Train to Memphis) writes that, given Jorgensen's attention to detail, the author is "either a madman or a great detective." While so many Presley books are written by authors who never seem to overcome their poetic sense of awe regarding the King, Jorgensen, being an RCA executive, couches the story of Presley's life in the gritty details of the artist's work and gets past the myths, giving readers a glimpse of what it might have been like to be Elvis. Hence, his is a truly insightful book. 150 photos in color and b&amp;w. Editor, Calvert D.

From the apocalyptic satire of Dr. Strangelove, to the epic vision of 2001: A Space Odyssey, to the dystopian nightmare of A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick produced a wide-ranging body of work cherished by film lovers the world over. But because of the moral complexity of his movies--and his meticulous style of filmmaking and legendary personal eccentricities--he was often misunderstood by colleagues and critics. This misunderstanding continued even after his death, in the critical controversy surrounding his final film Eyes Wide Shut. <p>In Kubrick, author and screenwriter Michael Herr gives a personal look at the allegedly reclusive, compulsively brilliant director. He also recounts the evolution of their unique friendship, from their first meeting at a screening for The Shining in 1980, to their collaboration on the screenplay for Full Metal Jacket, through years of marathon phone conversations on topics ranging from film and technology to philosophy and literature--the last of which occurred just days before the director's death. </p><p>In describing Kubrick, Herr strips away the myths surrounding his friend, revealing a man who was not introverted and misanthropic (as the media and his biographers claimed), but instead warm, gregarious, and endlessly inquisitive. He was also profoundly complicated. Though he loved America-and even embraced such pop culture touchstones as professional football and TV sitcoms--he permanently emigrated to England because of his distrust of Hollywood. Though he disdained elitism, he would only allow the most brilliant and talented inside his inner circle. He had a tremendous love and respect for the actors and screenwriters he worked with, but his style of filmmaking often led to bitter confrontations. </p><p>Filled with personal insights and previously untold anecdotes, Michael Herr's Kubrick is a probing view into the director's inner life, capturing the creative passion and powerful intellect of one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. </p><p>"You could always tell it was a Stanley Kubrick movie the moment it started, but he never made the same movie twice. It was often said that the people in Stanley's movies live in separate spaces on the screen, most often alone no matter what the company, but that was something that had been in the air since the early days of the late century, we've all breathed it, artists breathed it more deeply, and exhaled it as work. It was through those spaces, and in the distances between them, and their arrangement on the screen, that you can find the essence of Stanley's sympathy.... In all of the media's mischief and misapprehension, there was a lingering innuendo that he really only made movies to get himself through a bad case of chronic social anxiety disorder, but in fact he had his friends, many of them, who tell another story. An artist's isolation has nothing to do with physical circumstances anyway, with how publicly or privately he seems to be doing his work. It's more about tempo, intuition, experiment, and the kind of silence you don't come by easily these days, and not at all if you're passive. Out of this situation, the only situation he could tolerate, he made films of an incredible purity."--From Kubrick by Michael Herr </p><p>Michael Herr is a journalist, screenwriter, and novelist.

In 1901 Andrew Gennett put all of his money into a tract of timber along the Chattooga River watershed, which traverses parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. By the time he wrote his memoir almost forty years later, Gennett had outwitted and outworked countless competitors in the southern mountains to make his mark as one of the region's most seasoned, innovative, and successful lumbermen.</p><p>His recollections of a rough-and-ready outdoors life are filled with details of logging, from the first "cruise" of a timber stand to the moment when the last board lies "on sticks" in the mill yard. He tells how massive poplars, oaks, and other hardwoods had to be felled and trimmed by hand, dragged down mountain slopes by draft animals, floated downstream or carried by rail to the mill, and then sawn, graded, and stacked for drying. He tells of buying timber rights in a land market filled with "sharp" operators, where titles and surveys were often contested and kinship and custom were on an equal footing with the law.</p><p>Gennett saw more than potential "boardfeet" when he looked at a tree. He recalls, for instance, his efforts to convince the U.S. Forest Service to purchase undisturbed areas of wilderness at a time when its mandate was to condemn and buy up farmed-out and clear-cut land. One such sale initiated by Gennett would become the Joyce Kilmer Wilderness in North Carolina.</p><p>Filled with logging lore and portraits of the southern mountains and their people, <i>Sound Wormy</i> adds an absorbing new chapter to the region's natural and environmental history.</p></p><p><b>Andrew Gennett (Author) </b><br> ANDREW GENNETT (1874&#x2013;1942) was a native of Nashville, Tennessee.

The symbol of yin and yang is a circle divided into two halves by an S-shaped line, with one half black and the other half white. </p><p> The circle represents the unity of the universe, consisting of the yin (black) aspects and the yang (white) aspects, inseparable in every manifestation of the whole. Within each half there is a smaller circle of the opposite color, which means that each principle contains the seed of the other. At the culminating moment of deployment and expression, each principle changes into its polar opposite so that the force of eternal equilibrium can do its work. </p><p> <b><i>The Equilibrium of the Universe Depends on Polarity</i></b> </p><p> According to the Tao, the universe is the product of the polarity existing within the primordial unity: rest and motion, contraction and expansion, condensation and scattering, moving backward and moving forward. From the most simple and peculiar manifestations to the most complex and universal ones, every being expresses this original polarity. The interrelationship between yin and yang generates all living things that inhabit the universe. </p><p> The Tao philosophy is based on the search for balance and the integration of opposing energy forces that are complementary to each other. </p><p> <i><b>Yin and Yang</b></i> </p><p> Yin energy represents the feminine: passivity, night, wetness, cold, water, and the moon. The woman, with all her sexual secretions and fluids, constitutes a yin essence that provides the necessary protection that allows the male's semen to become an embryo. </p><p> The woman contains an inexhaustible reserve of yin energy that is activated by sexual arousal. The female orgasm strengthens vital energy, improves health, and prolongs youth. </p><p> Due to the fact that a woman's sexual potential is more energetic and open, almost all texts on this subject place a greater emphasis on educating the man so both lovers can reach an equivalent level of satisfaction. </p><p> Yang energy represents the masculine: activity, day, dryness, sun, and fire. Man's sperm is a precious gift, the source of his physical health and vital energy. This vital energy will diminish unless it is compensated by an equivalent amount of female yin energy, which is why the man must seek to satisfy the woman each time he has sexual contact with her. That way, both will benefit the other during each act of lovemaking: he will strengthen his vital essence, and she will stimulate and intensify her yin essence. </p><p> According to Taoist thinking, the sexual feature of yin is slower excitation, but this also means that a woman is slower to quit at the moment when she needs more sexual stimulation. On the contrary, yang's sexual feature is easy excitability, which allows the man to achieve maximum pleasure instantly. </p><p> The man needs to learn to prolong the sexual act without reaching orgasm so that both energies can merge and fuse. By increasing the time his member remains inside the woman, he will absorb the yin essence that will in turn revitalize him. </p><p> When the man's yang force and the woman's yin force unite, they create life in the universe. </p><p> <b></b></p><b>Infinite Pleasure</b> <p> There are physical and mental exercises that enable a couple having sexual problems to find a balance. These ancient techniques are very effective for people who play routine, stereotyped, or rigid roles in their sexual relations, which may eventually lead to a loss of sexual desire. </p><p> First of all, lovers should work on developing the tenderness of their feelings and express them through caressing each other. Each partner must caress the other in a slow and soft manner, with yin sensitivity. In doing so, not only do the mouth and the fingers take part, but so does the whole body, including those parts that are not usually explored erotically. </p><p> While the partners caress each other, both should focus mentally on the image of a sun embracing the moon with its light beams -- two vital energies becoming integrated. </p><p> The man should excite the woman until they both reach maximum wetness in their erogenous zones. Upon achieving this yin sensation, it is time for the intervention of the yang, with the man's penetration of the woman until the couple achieves maximum pleasure. </p><p> Having completed the sexual act in a state of ecstasy, the couple must wait a few minutes and allow their bodies to relax completely. When they reach this restful state, the lovers should visualize the image of an integrated earth and sky, while holding hands and kissing at the same time. </p><p> If the lovers start caressing each other again, they may get excited anew and perform the sexual act more than twice a day. </p><p> If a couple performs these exercises every day for some time, they will successfully harmonize their yin and yang energies and will experience the highest embodiment of love. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by Mabel Iam</p></p><h2>Royal horses</h2><p>Beautiful full-color pictures accompany the text about horses belonging to Royals - especially Queen Elizabeth!</p><p></p><h2>The Illustrated Step-by-Step Guide to Making Pop-Ups &amp; Novelty Cards: A Masterclass In The Art Of Paper Engineering</h2><p>How to create pop-up cards with 100 innovative techniques and projects, shown in 1000 pictures.</p><p>Trish Phillips studied Graphic Design at Camberwell College of Art in London.

In Mexico, nearly five centuries after the Spanish Conquest, the descendants of the Aztec and the Maya may no longer build pyramids, but their rural dwellings reflect the past in other ways: perfectly adapted to their environment, they incorporate natural materials such as palm for thatching, wattle, stones, adobe bricks and wood. They include an astonishing variety of forms - round, square, rectangular - with roofs that can be conical or pyramidal.<br>In larger villages and mestizo towns, rooms are often grouped around an inner courtyard; eye-catching facades are painted in vibrant colors. A quite different kind of tradition is found in the rural haciendas, long past their Golden Age but now finding new patrons keen to restore or recreate them and their designs. In the 19th century especially, Gothic pointed arches, medieval battlements and Moorish minarets were transposed to Mexican landscapes of agave and prickly pear. Luxuriant gardens, tiles from England and statues from Paris completed the picture. Almost totally self-sufficient, haciendas were the economic backbone of rural Mexico from Conquest to Revolution.<br>With the aid of plans and other historical illustrations, Chloe Sayer traces the story of traditional building and defines in detail the characteristics of architecture both private and public, rural and urban, Indian and colonial. Mariana Yampolsky's glorious photographs represent the summation of a lifetime's work.<br>This is one of those rare books that is both informed and inspirational. The result is also timely: many trained architects are now incorporating natural materials into their buildings and drawing inspiration from popular dwellings. Ironically, the Mexican countryside is itself experiencing a shift towards "modern" materials and forms: these pages are the last record of centuries of tradition.</p><p></p><h2>Mysterious World of Doctor Strange</h2><p>Mysterious World of Doctor Strange</p><p>"As with nearly every DK book I've ever read, this collection by Billy Wrecks and Danny Graydon (with a foreword by comics writing icon, Roger Stern) succeeds in being exhaustive yet condensed, providing the reader with access to just about everything that has touched Doctor StephenStrange's life since he became the Master of the Mystic Arts.

Starting in 1982 as a bad inker for Marvel Comics, he swiftly evolved into a not-so-bad artist. By the late 1980s, he had begun to develop his own unique graphic style, with mainstream projects like Cosmic Odyssey and Batman: Gotham by Gaslight. In 1994, he published the first Hellboy series through Dark Horse. There are thirteen <i>Hellboy</i> graphic novels (with more on the way), several spinoff titles (<i>B.P.R.D., Lobster Johnson, Abe Sapien, and Sir Edward Grey: Witchfinder</i>), prose books, animated films, and two live-action films starring Ron Perlman. Along the way he worked on Francis Ford Coppola's film <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), was a production designer for <i>Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire</i> (2001), and was the visual consultant to director Guillermo del Toro on <i>Blade II</i> (2002), <i>Hellboy</i> (2004), and <i>Hellboy II: The Golden Army </i>(2008).

Addressing these issues is essential. Ignoring racial differences--race blindness--has failed. Focusing on individual achievement has diverted us from tackling pervasive inequalities. Now, in a powerful and challenging book, Lani Guinier and Gerald Torres propose a radical new way to confront race in the twenty-first century. </p><p> Given the complex relationship between race and power in America, engaging race means engaging standard winner-take-all hierarchies of power as well. Terming their concept "political race," Guinier and Torres call for the building of grass-roots, cross-racial coalitions to remake those structures of power by fostering public participation in politics and reforming the process of democracy. Their illuminating and moving stories of political race in action include the coalition of Hispanic and black leaders who devised the Texas Ten Percent Plan to establish equitable state college admissions criteria, and the struggle of black workers in North Carolina for fair working conditions that drew on the strength and won the support of the entire local community. </p><p> The aim of political race is not merely to remedy racial injustices, but to create truly participatory democracy, where people of all races feel empowered to effect changes that will improve conditions for everyone. In a book that is ultimately not only aspirational but inspirational, Guinier and Torres envision a social justice movement that could transform the nature of democracy in America. </p></p><p>Lani Guinier is Bennett Boskey Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.Guinier and Torres issue a clarion call for the progressive possibilities of racial politics in the twenty-first century. <i>The Miner's Canary</i> convincingly demonstrates the positive role that racial identification has played and can continue to play in expanding, deepening, and enriching American democracy.<br> --Melissa Nobles, Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br><br><i>The Miner's Canary</i> is conceptually imaginative and politically inspiring. It is generously inclusive where other accounts of race and power are harshly exclusive. Lani Guinier and Gerald Torres combine sober analysis and models of democratic activism.<br> --Nancy L. Rosenblum, author of <i>Liberalism and the Moral Life</i><br><br>Lani Guinier and Gerald Torres sing a powerful song in lyrical, accessible, sophisticated tones: Race exists, race positively shapes identity, and organizing around race can save our society.

Haney L�pez, author of <i>White by Law: The Legal Construction of Race</i><br><br>Rejecting the unacceptable choice between colorblindness and identity politics, Lani Guinier and Gerald Torres show us how race consciousness can mobilize people across racial categories to confront structural injustice on issues ranging from education to union organizing, from voting rights to prisons.

Bell, author of <i>Faces at the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism</i><br><br>In this outstanding, trenchant, and ultimately uplifting book, Lani Guinier and Gerald Torres demonstrate how a racial order still profoundly structures the life chances of all Americans, and convincingly argue that racially based social movements have historically, and can again, promote a truly egalitarian society. <i>The Miner's Canary</i> is sure to become required reading for all those who seek to understand the racial divide as well as those who care about the future of the American polity.<br> --Michael C. Dawson, author of <i>Behind the Mule: Race and Class in African-American Politics</i><br><br>I recommend this book to every thoughtful U.S. citizen. We all need to get a better analytic grip on the phenomenon of "race." We all need to rethink outdated democratic systems. We all need help in organizing human action across lines of division. <i>The Miner's Canary</i> shows how the experiences of people of color are a key diagnostic tool, drawing attention to flaws in the existing system and galvanizing practical ways to change it for the better. Guinier and Torres have got it exactly right.<br> --Jane J. Mansbridge, author of <i>Beyond Adversary Democracy</i><br><br><i>The Miner's Canary</i> is thoughtful, provocative, and timely. It persuasively develops the idea of "political race," a concept that identifies racial literacy as a new way to think about social change in American society.

Suitable for students and general readers, it gives an introduction to philosophy.</p><p>One of his great works, and a must-read for any student of philosophy, The Problems of Philosophy was written in 1912 as an introduction to Russell's thought. <p> As an empiricist, Russell starts at the beginning with this question: Is there any knowledge in the world that is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? This, according to Russell, is where the work of philosophy begins. He covers topics such as reality, the nature of matter, inductive reasoning, truth, and the limits of philosophical knowledge. </p><p> As one of the greatest minds in Western philosophy, Russell's thoughts are profoundly informative and provocative and suitable for anyone wishing to expand his mind.</p>Bertrand Arthur William Russell, (1872-1970) was an English philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, and social critic. Although he spent the majority of his life in England, he was born in Wales, where he also died. Russell led the British &#34;revolt against idealism&#34; in the early 1900s. He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his prot�g� Wittgenstein and his elder Frege, and is widely held to be one of the 20th century&#39;s most important logicians.</p><h2>Dog Eat Dog</h2><p>Carved from a lifetime of experience that runs the gamut from incarceration to liberation, Dog Eat Dog is the story of three men who are all out of prison and now have the task of adapting themselves to civilian life. The California three strikes law looms over them, but what the hell, they're going to do it, and they're going to do it their way.<br>Troy, an aloof mastermind, seeks an uncomplicated, clean life but cannot get away from his hatred for the system. Diesel is on the mob's payroll and his interest in his suburban home and his nagging wife is waning. The loose cannon of the trio, Mad Dog, is possessed by true demons within that simply lead him from the situation to the next.<br>One more hit, one more jackpot, and they'll all be satisfied. Troy constructs the perfect crime and they pull it off, but in the aftermath, they keep finding the law surrounding them wherever they go.</p><p>Ex-convict Bunker proved he could write a strong, dark thriller with his first book, No Beast So Fierce. For his latest effort, he returns to the same kind of story -- smart but doomed ex-cons doing the only kind of thing they know how to do. Troy Cameron came from a wealthy Beverly Hills family before reform school and San Quentin knocked off some of the polish. Now he has linked up with a pair of psychopathic colleagues to prey on other criminals. In Bunker&#39;s hands, the material takes on a great deal of energy and even sympathy for the devils.<p><b>Edward Bunker</b> lives in Los Angeles with his wife.

Lisi has added such regional trappings as quilts, dulcimers, homespun clothing, and baskets. Endpapers capture the blue beauty of the mountains first in winter and then in spring. The straightforward text appears in a free-verse format on double pages, which alternate with double-spread paintings. The illustrator has chosen a romanticized, realistic style that features beautiful people, with bear motifs, Christmas roses, and doves used symbolically. The animals are realistically rendered and believable while the human characters have vacant expressions that detract from their appeal. Libraries that already own Marianna Mayer's (Macmillan, 1984) or Michael Hague's (Holt, 1991) romantic versions of Beauty and the Beast may consider this one an additional purchase.<br><i>Barbara Chatton, College of Education, University of Wyoming, Laramie</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 6-9. This picture book for older readers is sometimes reminiscent of the often-rendered story "East o' the Sun and West o' the Moon." In the Great Smoky Mountains, a father picking Christmas roses for his youngest daughter, Nell, runs afoul of a large white bear. To save her father, Nell agrees to travel to the bear's castle, where she discovers that her host, Snowbear Whittington, is really a handsome young man under a witch's spell. Lisi's watercolors have a classic fairy-tale feel to them, but the figures, though technically well rendered, seem posed and stiff, and the faces (especially Nell's) lack expression. Hooks' retelling, however, is handled nicely enough to lend itself to both storytelling and reading aloud, and the classically romantic presentation may even attract middle-grade girls. <i>Janice Del Negro</i></p><h2>The Innocents Abroad</h2><p><b><i>The Innocents Abroad </i></b> chronicles Mark Twain's pleasure cruise on board the chartered vessel <i>Quaker City </i> through Europe and the Holy Land with a group of religious pilgrims in 1867. It was the best selling of Twain's works during his lifetime.</p><p>14 1.5-hour cassettesThe Innocents Abroad is one of the most prominent and influential travel books ever written about Europe and the Holy Land. In it, the collision of the American &#34;New Barbarians&#34; and the European &#34;Old World&#34; provides much comic fodder for Mark Twain--and a remarkably perceptive lens on the human condition. Gleefully skewering the ethos of American tourism in Europe, Twain&#39;s lively satire ultimately reveals just what it is that defines cultural identity. As Twain himself points out, &#34;Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one&#39;s lifetime.&#34; And Jane Jacobs observes in her Introduction, &#34;If the reader is American, he may also find himself on a tour of his own psyche.&#34;</p><h2>The History Man</h2><p><p>Set in Watermouth University, this is the story of Barbara and Howard Kirk, their very modern marriage and their equally radical politics.

Its particular strength lies in its discussion of the emotional aspects of caregiving, i.e., family crisis, acceptance, letting go, and moving on. It is less useful as a resource for explaining the symptoms, traits, and progression of the disease or discussing important issues, such as ongoing medical care and financial and legal planning.

For many people throughout Canada and the rest of the world, 1914 was important because it marked the beginning of the First World War. While the year became significant for the same reason in Newfoundland, it was not originally so. Newfoundland&#x2019;s economy depended on the sea, and the seal hunt was vital. During the spring of 1914, seventy-seven men of the S.S. <i>Newfoundland </i>died and many more were injured when they became lost on the ice fields, locally known as &#x201c;the front,&#x201d; off the north�east coast. What became known as the <i>Newfoundland</i>sealing disaster galvanized popular discontent against mercantile profiteering and recklessness on the seal hunt, and influenced Newfoundland politics. The Great War muted this discontent and fostered a nationalist political culture founded on notions of honour, sacrifice, and patriotism&#x2014;particularly after the mass deaths in the Royal Newfoundland Regiment at Beaumont Hamel. This nationalism was easily shaken, however, in the post-war economic crisis that plagued Newfoundland, frustrating more progressive attempts to deal with economic and social problems, and led to the collapse of responsible gov�ernment in 1934. Although sealers had died in 1914 and soldiers fell in the years of the Great War, it was liberal democracy in Newfoundland that was the final casualty in the bitter struggles over the meaning of these events.</p><p><b> SEAN CADIGAN </b> has been a professor of history at Memorial University, Newfoundland and Labrador, since 2001 and now serves as department head.

Samir Amin offers a provocative analysis of resistance to capitalism and imperialism and calls for a new politics of opposition. Capitalism is a global system, so ultimately any successful challenge to it must be organized on the same level: an &#x201c;internationalism of peoples.&#x201d;</p><p>Throughout the twentieth century the socialist and communist internationals, national liberation movements, and great revolutions have presented challenges to the world order. Amin provides a succinct discussion of the successes and failures of these mobilizations, in order to assess the present struggle. Neoliberalism and the drive for military hegemony by the United States have spawned new political and social movements of resistance and attempts at international organization through the World Social Forum. Amin assesses the potential and limitations of these movements to confront global capitalism in the twenty-first century. <b>The World We Wish to See</b> makes a distinction between &#x201c;political cultures and conflict&#x201d; and &#x201c;political cultures of consensus.&#x201d; A new politics of struggle is needed; one that is not afraid to confront the power of capitalism, one that is both critical and self-critical.</p><p>In this persuasive argument, Amin explains that effective opposition must be based on the construction of a &#x201c;convergence in diversity&#x201d; of oppressed and exploited people whether they are workers, peasants, students, or any other opponent of capitalism and imperialism. What is needed is a new &#x201c;international&#x201d; that has an open and flexible organizational structure to coordinate the work of opposition movements around the world.</p><p>The World We Wish to See is a bold book, calling for an international movement that can successfully transcend the current world order, in order to pursue a better world. Amin&#x2019;s lucid analysis provides a firm basis for furthering this objective.</p></p><p><p><b>Samir Amin<b> is director of the Third World Forum in Dakar, Senegal.

He served on the faculties of four major state universities during his career: North Carolina State University, Oklahoma State University, the University of Georgia, and the University of Missouri. Growing concerns for the lack of ecological, social, and economic sustainability of American agriculture during the 1980s led to broader concerns for the lack of sustainability for American society in general. As an economist, Dr. Ikerd eventually came to understand that growing threats to ecological and social sustainability are rooted in the neoclassical paradigm of economic development, which is inherently extractive and exploitative, and thus, is not sustainable. Dr. Ikerd spent the last half of his academic career and much of his time since retirement developing and testing the concepts and principles of an alternative development paradigm, the economics of sustainability, which are elucidated in this book.</p><h2>Finale: An Easy Guide to Music Notation - Third Edition</h2><p>(Berklee Press).

Beginning from the use of crucifixion as a form of execution practised among barbarian peoples, Dr Hengel shows how it was employed in the Roman empire, in the Greek-speaking world and among the Jews. He also investigates how far &#39;crucifixion&#39; was a term used metaphorically or in philosophical discussion. His conclusions bring out more starkly than ever the scandal presented by the Christian message of the crucified Son of God and show that Jesus was seen to have died, not just a cruel death, but one of the worst forms of death devised by man for man. Martin Hengel was Professor of New Testament and Early Judaism in the University of Tubingen.</p><p>Crucifixion - in the ancient world and the folly of the message of the cross.Martin Hengel was Professor Emeritus of New Testament and Early Judaism at the University of Tubingen in Germany until his death in 2009.</p><h2>Empress Zenobia: Palmyra&#39;s Rebel Queen</h2><p><p>The ancient sources for the life and times of Zenobia are sparse, and the surviving literary works are biased towards the Roman point of view, much as are the sources for two other famous women who challenged Rome, Cleopatra and Boudica. In <i>Empress Zenobia</i>, Pat Southern seeks to tell the other side of the legendary 3rd century queen's place in history. <br>As queen of Palmyra (present-day Syria), Zenobia was acknowledged in her lifetime as beautiful and clever, gathering round her at the Palmyrene court writers and poets, artists and philosophers. It was said that Zenobia claimed descent from Cleopatra, which cannot be true but is indicative of how she saw herself and how she intended to be seen by others at home and abroad. This lively narrative explores the legendary queen and charts the progression of her unequivocal declaration, not only of independence from Rome, but of supremacy. Initially, Zenobia acknowledged the suzerainty of the Roman Emperors, but finally began to call herself Augusta and her son Vaballathus Augustus. There could be no clearer challenge to the authority of Rome in the east, drawing the Emperor Aurelian to the final battles and the submission of Palmyra in AD 272. </p><p>Zenobia's story has inspired many melodramatic fictions but few factual volumes of any authority have been published. Pat Southern's book is a lively account that is both up to date and authoritative, as well as thoroughly engaging.</p></p><p><p>Pat Southern is an expert on Classical History and is the author of many authoritative books in this area including <em>The Roman</em> <em>Empire from Severus to Constantine</em>; <em>The Late Roman Army</em> and biographies of Augustus and Domitian (all published by Routledge).</p>"Verdict: Southern's biography is an accessible and vital addition to Roman historical knowledge. Exhaustive research and extensive footnotes make this an excellent aid to undergraduate or graduate research. Recommended for academic libraries. Background: Southern (<em>The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine; The Roman Army</em>) examines the life and times of Zenobia, who ruled Palmyra as regent to her son, Vaballathus, in the late third century C.E. The author skillfully presents the turbulent world of the late Roman Empire and Zenobia's rise to power. Using historical records and archaeological evidence, Southern portrays Zenobia as less of a rebel or power-hungry ruler than a leader who had the interest of her people and the security of her realm at heart; she also carefully considers other theories and opinions that have arisen over the centuries." &#x2014; Melinda Gottesman, <em>Library Journal</em> (Xpress Reviews), February 15, 2009<br><br>"A detailed evaluation of current Zenobian studies, taking robust stands on disputed points, such as the lack of evidence for 3rd-century city walls protecting Palmyra ... and Zenobia's ultimate fate." - <em>The Times Higher Education Supplement</em><br><br>"this book...contains all we are ever likely to know about her[Zenobia]"<br>4 July 2009 (<i>The American Spectator</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Verdict: Southern&#x2019;s biography is an accessible and vital addition to Roman historical knowledge.

In every one, dark forces threatened Greece; terrible evil was poised to reenter the world. The future held only one hope: a half-caste Spartan boy, Parmenion. So Tamis made it her mission to see that Parmenion would before the deadliest warrior in the world -- no matter what the cost.<br>Raised to manhood in Sparta, bullied and forced to fight for his life every day, Parmenion had no notion of the unseen dimensions of magic and mystery that shaped his fate. He grew in strength and cunning. His military genius earned him the title Strategos in Sparta. His triumphs for the city of Thebes made him a hero. And finally his fate led him to the service of Philip of Macedon.<br>As Tamis had foreseen, Parmenion's destiny was tied to the Dark God, to Philip, and to the yet-unborn Alexander. All too soon the future was upon them. Parmenion stood poised to defeat evil -- or to open the gate for the Dark God to reenter the world.</p><p>David Gemmell&#39;s first novel, LEGEND was published in 1984, beginning his acclaimed Drenai saga. He was widely regarded as Britain&#39;s king of heroic fantasy. He died in July 2006.This enjoyable historical fantasy set in ancient Greece spans three decades in the career of Parmenion, a Spartan of mixed ancestry whose life is being shaped and monitored by an aging seeress. Scorned as a half-breed by the Spartans, he leaves vowing to wreak vengeance--which he does, at the head of a victorious Theban ar- my. Parmenion goes on to become Greece's preeminent soldier of fortune, a brilliant military strategist and tactician. Eventually, he hires on to Philip, the beleaguered king of Macedonia. Parmenion provides the young king with military help but, more importantly, intervenes in a ceremony meant to secure the siring of a child whose birth might signal the ultimate triumph of evil. Parmenion's final--and most meaningful--battle takes place not in this world but in Hades, where the forces of evil are held at bay long enough to deny the Dark God dominion over the newly born soul of Alexander the Great.

Airplane mechanics are rewarded with balloons and pinwheels. Another manager calls his employees&#x2019; mothers and thanks them for raising such industrious children. There are ideas from the offbeat (The Margarita Award) to the company-wide (a quiet room) to the embarrassingly simple (a hand-written thank you note) to the wacky (the Laugh-a-Day challenge) to the formal (a two-week promotion to special assistant to the president). Each section includes no-cost rewards and low-cost rewards, both public and private, making this new edition an indispensable resource for making the person/achievement/reward equation work.</p><p>Empowerment.

Mayors met him at the train station and presented him with the key to the city, parades and throngs of cheering crowds escorted him to City Hall, and special luncheons were held in his honor. Eventually dubbed the "King of Jazz," Whiteman grew into one of the biggest promoters of players, singers, and arrangers of all times. Many well-known musicians got their first big boost in his band including Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Bing Crosby, Frank Trumbauer, Bix Beiderbecke, Johnny Mercer, Mildred Bailey, and Ferde Grof�.<br><br>When it came to jazz, Whiteman was a trailblazer. He invented "symphonic jazz" and gave the first performance of Gershwin's <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i>, one of the most enduringly popular of all jazz-influenced musical works of the 20th century. He perfected the one-nighter concert tours, traveling across the country by train, from city to city, with his unique brand of music.

In this regard, Christian Kabbalah is quite different from its Jewish roots, and Gnostic Christianity is very different from orthodox Christianity. Both are about experiencing God and evolving toward God, rather than just studying theology. <br> <br>This groundbreaking work is the first to present the Christian Gnosis of the Kabbalah in a practical and deeply esoteric way. It takes the reader from the basic ideas of the Kabbalah to in-depth explorations of the Tree of Life. Gnostic legends and myths of the Holy Mother, St. Lazarus, St. Mary Magdalene, and Jesus are woven into the study of the Holy Sefirot as well as commentaries on the Ten Commandments and The Beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount. <br></p><p><p><strong>Tau Malachi's</strong> (Malachi eben Ha-Elijah's) spiritual journey began when he met the acquaintance of a Tau of the Sophian Tradition of Gnostic Christianity, Tau Elijah ben Miriam. He received the oral tradition of Sophian Gnosticism from Tau Elijah, and has been a student and practitioner of Gnostic Christianity for over thirty-five years. In 1983 he founded Sophia Fellowship as an expression of the tradition, and has been teaching and initiating others into Christian Gnosticism, Rosicrucian Philosophy and Christian Kabbalah since that time. He is an initiate of Ordo Sanctus Gnosis and serves as an Elder and Tau within the Sophian lineage.</p> <p>Tau Malachi is also a Chevalier (a dubbed Knight) in the International Order of Chivalric Companions, a Martinist, and is an ordained and consecrated Independent Bishop. He is co-founder of The Gnostic Apostolic Church of Sophia and is among the leading exponents of Christian Gnosticism and Kabbalah in our times.</p> <p>Along with his exploration of the Western Mystery Tradition, he has studied extensively in several Eastern Traditions, such as Vajrayana Buddhism and Vedanta, and he also studied within a Middle Eastern Tradition of Sufism, as well as becoming involved in Native American Shamanism. Though Gnostic Christianity has always been his heart's path.</p>Chapter One: The Kabbalah of Gnostic Christianity <br> <br> Purpose and Nature of the Kabbalah <br> <p>The Kabbalah is an archaic system of Jewish Mysticism that has its roots in the assembly of prophets of ancient Israel and the Merkavah Mysticism of Palestine during the time of Jesus (Yeshua in Aramaic). Considering that Yeshua was Jewish and his disciples were Jewish, and understanding him to be a mystic and prophet of his time, it is reasonable to assume that he taught a form of the mystical tradition that has come to be known as the Kabbalah.</p> <p>For this reason, many mystical and gnostic currents of Christianity have arisen that take the Kabbalah as their foundation. This is certainly true of the Sophian Tradition, which is so interwoven with the teachings of the Kabbalah that it is impossible to separate out Gnosticism and Kabbalah in the Tradition. Essentially, one might call the Sophian Tradition a Christian Kabbalah or a form of Gnostic Christianity that draws heavily upon its Judaic roots. Therefore, to explore Gnostic Christianity, as expressed in the Sophian Tradition, we must explore some of the basic ideas of the Kabbalah from which the teachings and principles of our Gnostic Christianity are derived.</p> <p>The principal teachings of the Kabbalah were designed to explore and find answers to some basic questions:</p> <ul> <li>The nature and attributes of God and the Godhead </li> <li>The development of a cosmology </li> <li>The mystery of the creation of angels and humankind </li> <li>The destiny of humankind and angels </li> <li>The nature of the human soul and its connection to the divine </li> <li>The nature of cosmic forces-angels, demons, elementals and such </li> <li>The inner meaning of the revealed law and Holy Gospel </li> <li>The transcendental symbolism of numbers and geometrical shapes </li> <li>The mysteries contained in the Hebrew letters </li> <li>The balance in the play of cosmic forces </li> <li>The mystery of divine revelation and prophetic states of consciousness </li> <li>The mystery of the divine incarnation and the divine plan on earth </li> </ul> <p>Considering the vast height, depth, and breadth of these metaphysical questions, one can imagine the enormous amount of esoteric teachings, practices, and literature that has formed around the Kabbalah in the course of thousands of years. Although there are many modern truth-seekers who have read a book or two on the Kabbalah and mistakenly assumed they know the Kabbalah, the truth is that even a master of the Tradition, who has studied and practiced the Kabbalah all of his or her life and who actively embodies something of the enlightenment experience it represents, would not claim to know the Kabbalah. One could say that God knows the Kabbalah and that, for our part, we know what we have received of it in our own experience&#x2015;which is a far cry from knowing the Kabbalah as God knows it.</p> <p>Essentially, the teachings of the Kabbalah represent the accumulated knowledge, understanding, and wisdom of initiates, which have been gathered from their own direct spiritual experience of the metaphysical dimensions of creatures, creation, and God. The Kabbalah itself is the knowledge, understanding, and wisdom of the true nature of creatures, creation, and God-which is known in full only to God. If the whole of the Kabbalah is in a book, then it is the heavenly Book of Life of which the Holy Scriptures speak, and not any earthly book.</p> <p>The teachings of the Kabbalah are founded upon the Bible, along with other books of Scripture that did not make their way into the canonized Bible. Thus, to study and understand the Kabbalah in its proper context is to study and understand the Scriptures also. Just as many mistakenly assume that they know the Kabbalah from reading a book or two, likewise many assume that they are knowledgeable in the Kabbalah without being well-studied in the Scriptures. Ultimately, however, one cannot study and understand the Kabbalah without also studying and gaining some understanding of the Holy Scriptures. To engage in the study and practice of the Kabbalah is to embark upon a mystical journey into hidden levels of the Scriptures and the secret wisdom they contain. In essence, the Scriptures and the Kabbalah are one and the same.</p> Three Branches of the Kabbalah <br> <p>The teachings of the Kabbalah are divided into three principal forms: the theoretical or contemplative Kabbalah, the meditative Kabbalah, and the practical or magical Kabbalah. The theoretical or contemplative Kabbalah is an intellectual study and contemplation of the principles, doctrines, and correspondences of esoteric wisdom, including gematria, the associations of numbers and geometrical patterns, and so on. The meditative Kabbalah represents the teachings and practices of mystical prayer and prophetic meditation-methods through which one can enter a higher state of consciousness and experience unification with the divine. The practical or magical Kabbalah represents teachings of invocations, incantations, rituals, and such, through which one is able to shift states of consciousness at will and to consciously direct hidden spiritual forces. From this, one will understand that the Kabbalah is both a mystical and a magical Tradition. Here, we will be dealing primarily with the contemplative Kabbalah and to some extent the meditative Kabbalah. The magical Kabbalah will be referred to in passing at different points of this book; however, it is not the subject of this work.</p> The Ten Holy Sefirot and the Tree of Life <br> <p>There are ten Sefirot (plural), which are generally referred to as Midot, meaning &#x201c;measurements&#x201d; or &#x201c;dimensions&#x201d; and, by extension, also meaning &#x201c;attributes&#x201d; or &#x201c;qualities.&#x201d; The Sefirot are emanations of the divine presence and power of God, or the infinite light of God, and they are vessels receiving God's light and transmitting it to creation. They are gradations of the involution of the infinite light into finite creation, and thus are gradations of the evolution of creatures on the path of return-like rungs on a ladder of light. When we read of Jacob's vision of a ladder reaching up from the earth to the heavens, upon which he beheld angels ascending and descending, the Kabbalah would say that that Jacob had a vision of the constellation of the Sefirot that forms the Tree of Life.</p> <p>The word Sefirah (singular) is related to the Hebrew word saper, meaning &#x201c;to express&#x201d; or &#x201c;to communicate,&#x201d; and to the word sapir, meaning &#x201c;sapphire,&#x201d; &#x201c;brilliance,&#x201d; or &#x201c;luminary.&#x201d; It is also related to the words sefar, meaning &#x201c;boundary&#x201d;; sefer, meaning &#x201c;book&#x201d;; and safar, meaning &#x201c;number.&#x201d; All of these terms represent related concepts and indicate the two basic functions of the Sefirot: lights or emanations that act to reveal and express God's presence and power (Shekinah); and vessels that limit and delineate the infinite light of God, bringing it down into the finite realm of numeration and boundary.</p> <p>Essentially, the Sefirot, and the various levels of their manifestation called Olamot or universes, represent the metaphysical structure of creation or the vehicle through which creature, creation, and God are connected and interact. In Genesis, ten utterances are listed through which God creates. These correspond with the ten Sefirot and suggest the idea of creature and creation as the revelation or expression of God and as the vessel receiving and imparting the divine presence-hence the body of God. Through the Sefirot, God reaches out to us and we are able to reach into God.</p> <p>The most common way these Sefirot are represented is as a glyph called the Tree of Life (Otz ha-Hayyim). The Sefirot are depicted as ten circles that form three triads, one atop, one in the middle, and one below, with a single Sefirah set as a pendant below the lowest triad. In this same configuration they also appear as ten circles divided into three columns-one to the right, one to the left, and one in the middle-which are called &#x201c;pillars.&#x201d; These are two ways to view the same glyph (figure 1, below). <br> <br>In the view of the three triads of Sefirot and one Sefirah as a pendant, the top triad is called the supernal triad, the triad in the middle is called the moral triad, the triad below is called the action triad. The Sefirah that appears as a pendant is called Malkut (Kingdom). Malkut is the &#x201c;fruit&#x201d; of the Tree of Life, as well as the vessel receiving the influence of all the emanations above it. In the view of the Tree of Life as three pillars, the right and left pillars are composed of three Sefirot each, and the middle pillar is composed of four Sefirot. The pillar on the right is called the Pillar of Mercy and the pillar on the left is called the Pillar of Severity-the Pillars of Jachin and Boaz in the temple of King Solomon. One is positive and the other negative; one is male and the other is female; one is white, the other is black-so that these two pillars represent the eternal play of opposites in dynamic interaction. Evil is imbalanced force, out of place or out of harmony. Severity in imbalance is cruelty and oppression, and mercy in imbalance is weakness that allows and facilitates great evil. True compassion is a dynamic balance of severity and mercy.</p> <p>The Middle Pillar is therefore the path of the ascension, representing the dynamic balance of all polarities or opposites, and the integration of everything that would otherwise be fragmented. The Kabbalah teaches the Middle Way, akin to what is found in forms of Hinduism and Buddhism in the Eastern schools. For this reason, whether the tree is viewed in terms of the triads or the three pillars, the Sefirah Tiferet (beauty), which is the Christ center on the tree, is in the middle.</p> <p>As there are ten circles representing the Sefirot on the Tree of Life, so also are there twenty-two lines connecting the Sefirot, to which the Hebrew letters are attributed. Thus the tree is composed of thirty-two paths, which in the Sefer Yetzirah are called the &#x201c;Thirty-Two Paths of Wisdom.&#x201d; &nbsp;Various correspondences are given to both the Sefirot and the Hebrew letters. Through the interrelationship of correspondences, initiates are able to look and see the mysteries contained in the Scriptures and are able to gain insight into the mysteries of creation and God. Yet more, they are able to receive the ongoing divine revelation in the same way as the prophets and apostles of God before them.</p> The Olamot-Universes <br> <p>The ten Sefirot manifest through five different levels or dimensions, which are called Olamot, meaning &#x201c;universes.&#x201d; These Olamot are known as the universe of Adam Kadmon (primordial human being), the universe of Atzilut (emanation or nearness), the universe of Beriyah (creation), the universe of Yetzirah (formation), and the universe of Asiyah (action or making). The Olamot extend from the supernal abode of the divine to the material plane of existence, the universe of Adam Kadmon being nearest to the light of the Infinite and Asiyah being the material plane of existence. The ten Sefirot manifest in each Olam, thus there are ten Sefirot of Adam Kadmon, ten Sefirot of Atzilut, ten Sefirot of Beriyah, ten Sefirot of Yetzirah, and ten Sefirot of Asiyah, for a total of fifty Sefirot, which are called the &#x201c;Fifty Gates of Understanding.&#x201d;</p> <p>These five Olamot correspond to the divine name of Yahweh (Yod-He-Vau-He), frequently called the &#x201c;Tetragrammaton&#x201d; because it is composed of four letters. Adam Kadmon is represented by the upper tip of the Yod (y), Atzilut by the body of the Yod, Beriyah by the first He (h), Yetzirah by the Vau (v), and Asiyah by the final He. This divine name is said to be contained in the universe of Adam Kadmon and it is said to contain all other divine names, the divine names being within it and yet being worn by it as &#x201c;garments.&#x201d;</p> <p>The divine name of Yeshua or Yeheshuah (Yod-He-Shin-Vau-He), which is the name of Yahweh with the addition of the letter Shin (w), represents the embodiment of the divine presence and power of Yahweh and thus something of the spiritual energy of Adam Kadmon. The universe of Adam Kadmon and the Sefirot it contains, therefore, represent the Soul of the Messiah. This gives insight into the title &#x201c;Son of Adam&#x201d; (son of man), used for Yeshua in the Gospels.</p> <p>To gain some insight into the nature of the Olamot, one might contemplate them in terms of the sun and its light and the moon that reflects the light. First, one must understand that, looking at the sun, one does not see the sun but rather sees the glory or radiance of the sun. Therefore, within and beyond what one sees is the sun itself. From the &#x201c;sun within the sun,&#x201d; light is generated and that hidden place of the generation of light would correspond to Adam Kadmon. The glory or light of the sun one beholds would correspond to Atzilut. The light passing to the moon would correspond to Beriyah. The light of the moon itself would correspond to Yetzirah, and the light of the full moon shining upon the earth would correspond to Asiyah. In a similar way, the light of the Infinite passes through the Olamot from Adam Kadmon to Asiyah, and thus, the supernal light is progressively veiled and reduced in intensity.</p> <p>Another way of gaining some understanding of the Olamot is to consider them at the level of human experience. The inmost will of a human being corresponds to the universe of Adam Kadmon. The level of pure awareness or preconceptual and undifferentiated mind corresponds to Atzilut. The process of thought itself corresponds to Beriyah. Speech or communication corresponds to Yetzirah, and action corresponds to Asiyah.</p> <p>Adam Kadmon = Will <br>Atzilut = Mind <br>Beriyah = Thought <br>Yetzirah = Speech <br>Asiyah = Action</p> <p>The best way to contemplate this is to consider the creative process of an architect who is designing a large building complex. First he or she decides what kind of buildings will fit the purposes for which they are being constructed. Then he or she draws up the corresponding plans and considers how each building will serve its function in relationship to the other structures. Finally, he or she gives orders to his or her workers and the actual construction begins.</p> <p>In our analogy, the level of Adam Kadmon is represented by the desire and decision of the architect to build before there is any particular plan in mind. Atzilut would be represented by the process of designing a plan for the building on the most abstract level. Once there is a blueprint, everything still remains at an abstract level and thought must be given to figure out exactly how the plan will work or how it can actually be implemented. Up to this point, everything has taken place in the architect's office, but now seeking to practically apply the plan, the architect must go to the site.</p> <p>Going to the site and thinking things through on a more practical level, bringing the idea down from the abstract symbolic form into something that can be implemented, would represent Beriyah. When the architect communicates the actual ideas and methods of construction to the workers, this would be akin to Yetzirah. The actual work of construction would correspond to Asiyah; the finished product itself would represent the final Sefirah of Asiyah (Malkut of Asiyah).</p> <p>The analogy can be taken even further into all purposeful human activity. Any time a person decides to do something, he or she conceives a general plan. As he or she gets closer to enacting it, his or her thought processes almost spontaneously trigger nerve impulses, which then travel through the body. The person's muscles follow the commands of the brain and bring about the corresponding action.</p> <p>We are experiencing something of the Olamot all of the time through...</p></p><h2>Pride of the Bimbos</h2><p><i>The Pride of the Bimbos</i> is John Sayles's outrageous, poignant and hilarious first novel, about a circus sideshow softball team&#x2014;The Brooklyn Bimbos&#x2014;who play in drag at scraggly small towns across the South.

Stephen Kinzer offers a surprising answer in this paradigm-shifting book. Two countries in the region, he argues, are America&#39;s logical partners in the twenty-first century: Turkey and Iran.

Calendar art appears in all manner of contexts in India: in chic elite living rooms, middle-class kitchens, urban slums, village huts; hung on walls, stuck on scooters and computers, propped up on machines, affixed to dashboards, tucked into wallets and lockets. In this beautifully illustrated book, Kajri Jain examines the power that calendar art wields in Indian mass culture, arguing that its meanings derive as much from the production and circulation of the images as from their visual features. <p></p><p>Jain draws on interviews with artists, printers, publishers, and consumers as well as analyses of the prints themselves to trace the economies&#x2014;of art, commerce, religion, and desire&#x2014;within which calendar images and ideas about them are formulated. For Jain, an analysis of the bazaar, or vernacular commercial arena, is crucial to understanding not only the calendar art that circulates within the bazaar but also India&#x2019;s postcolonial modernity and the ways that its mass culture has developed in close connection with a religiously inflected nationalism. The bazaar is characterized by the coexistence of seemingly incompatible elements: bourgeois-liberal and neoliberal modernism on the one hand, and vernacular discourses and practices on the other. Jain argues that from the colonial era to the present, capitalist expansion has depended on the maintenance of these multiple coexisting realms: the sacred, the commercial, and the artistic; the official and the vernacular.</p></p><p>&#34;A virtuoso examination of the `luminous banality&#39; of calendar art. In mapping the moral economy of bazaar Hinduism, it provides a history of much of twentieth-century India and predicts much of what might happen in the present century.&#34;--Christopher Pinney, author of &#34;Photos of the Gods&#34;: The Printed Image and Political Struggle in India&#34;In this groundbreaking book, Kajri Jain analyzes the &#39;frames of value&#39; surrounding the contemporary Indian genre of mass-produced prints often known as bazaar art, &#39;lurid, pungent, frequently tatty&#39; colored images of gods displayed on calendars. Recognizing that the value of these printed images to their viewers far exceeds their literal material value or the value that we might be tempted to assign to them in artistic terms, in a rich and vivid analysis based on firsthand research in the calendar-art industry Jain deals with their many values--social, political, religious, aesthetic, historical, affective, and libidinal. &#34;Gods in the Bazaar&#34; makes a significant theoretical contribution to globalizing our notion of aesthetic experience; in the sensuous and sacred economies of calendar art, what appears to be lurid and tatty can also be moving, precious, and exciting. Jain&#39;s deft weaving of art history, aesthetics, anthropology, and the study of popular visual culture is a tour de force and deserves a wide readership among students of all image-making traditions around the world.&#34;--Whitney Davis, Professor of History and Theory of Ancient and Modern Art, University of California, Berkeley</p><h2>Lord Mansfield: Justice in the Age of Reason</h2><p>In the first modern biography of Lord Mansfield (1705-1793), Norman Poser details the turbulent political life of eighteenth-century Britain&#39;s most powerful judge, serving as chief justice for an unprecedented thirty-two years. His legal decisions launched England on the path to abolishing slavery and the slave trade, modernized commercial law in ways that helped establish Britain as the world&#39;s leading industrial and trading nation, and his vigorous opposition to the American colonists stoked Revolutionary fires. Although his father and brother were Jacobite rebels loyal to the deposed King James II, Mansfield was able to rise through English society to become a member of its ruling aristocracy and a confidential advisor to two kings. Poser sets Mansfield&#39;s rulings in historical context while delving into Mansfield&#39;s circle, which included poets (Alexander Pope described him as &#34;his country&#39;s pride&#34;), artists, actors, clergymen, noblemen and women, and politicians. Still celebrated for his application of common sense and moral values to the formal and complicated English common law system, Mansfield brought a practical and humanistic approach to the law. His decisions continue to influence the legal systems of Canada, Britain, and the United States to an extent unmatched by any judge of the past. An illuminating account of one of the greatest legal minds, Lord Mansfield presents a vibrant look at Britain&#39;s Age of Reason through one of its central figures.</p><p>Norman S. Poser is professor emeritus at Brooklyn Law School."I read this book with much pleasure and instruction. It admirably fills a major gap in the body of legal historical literature - the absence of a comprehensive biography of arguably the most famous and influential Anglo-American judge of the modern era." Simon Devereaux, Department of History, University of Victoria<br><br>"A remarkable portrait of both a man and a legal age. I enjoyed the book tremendously, learned so much, and am deeply grateful. A master work." Kent Syverud, Ethan A. H.

Essential.&#x201d; CHOICE<br><br>&#x201c;In this thorough but highly readable biography, Norman Poser, professor emeritus at Brooklyn Law School, tackles both the life and legacy of this eighteenth century giant.&#x201d;&#x2015;The Gazette (Weekly Journal of the Law Society)<br><br>&#x201c;The first half of Norman Poser&#x2019;s biography provides a highly readable account of Mansfield&#x2019;s personal and political life [...] Poser&#x2019;s account is more effective as political than as judicial biography.

But for close to thirty years, between 1966 until his untimely death from prostate cancer in 1993, Frank Zappa was one of the most influential, innovative, and controversial musicians in contemporary and popular music (despite little radio airplay). Beginning with his band, the Mothers of Invention, Frank Zappa built a formidable career in rock and roll by combining a wide range of styles, including serious contemporary music, jazz, rhythm and blues, doo-wop, and social and political parody. Yet Zappa was often portrayed as a drug addict (even though he denounced drug use) and a fetishist (despite a normal married life). In Dangerous Kitchen: The Subversive World of Zappa, Kevin Courrier explodes those myths by illuminating the facts about this outrageously gifted composer. Courrier examines how Frank Zappa's emergence in American popular culture during the eclectic and experimental sixties was no accident. Courrier argues&nbsp; that Zappa's musical career which poked fun at middle-class conformity, the hippie sub-culture, disco, the rock industry, and the Reagan era had its roots in the artistic rebellion against Romanticism in the nineteenth century. The book draws links to the musical and cultural antecedents of Frank Zappa's career, including Erik Satie, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Igor Stravinsky, Charles Ives, and Zappa's true hero, Edgard Varese, who was as much a scientific inventor of electronic sounds as he was a dynamic avant-garde composer. This book examines Frank Zappa as a composer, performer, political artist, and American original.&nbsp;<br></p></p><p>Kevin Courrier is an entertainment journalist who lives in Toronto.

Happy trails!Travel writer Tony Huegel began introducing America to the concept of backcountry touring in 1993, when he launched his innovative "Byways" series of adventure driving guidebooks. He and his family had discovered that, thanks to their 4wd sport-utility vehicle, they could explore western wildlands and remote historic sites comfortably, conveniently and safely anytime. After growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area and earning a bachelor's degree in journalism at U.C. Berkeley, Tony worked as a reporter and photographer for newspapers in Wyoming, California and Idaho. His SUV-oriented backcountry adventure articles now appear regularly in Road &amp; Track magazine's new spinoff, Open Road, as well as 4Wheel Drive &amp; Sport Utility magazine. He and his family have lived in Idaho since 1985. It was in Idaho, a state noted for its vast, unspoiled expanses of publicly owned wildlands, that he and his family discovered that backpacks and blisters were unnecessary to enjoy wild and remote places of great natural beauty. In almost any stock SUV, they could easily explore backroads and 4x4 routes through some of the most spectacular landscapes in the West by day, and relax poolside by night.

He has been researching his own family tree since 1979 and has traced some lines back to about 1580.Herber's book is billed as "the complete guide to British genealogy and family history," and that is exactly what it is. Thoughtfully designed, this orderly, comprehensive, and elegant work guides the researcher (beginner or advanced) through the entire process of tracing British heritage, from obtaining information from living relatives to drawing family trees and starting research in the birth, marriage, death, or census records. Later chapters guide researchers to records that are more difficult to find and use, such as wills, parish registers, civil and ecclesiastical court records, poll books, and property records. Written for practitioners by a practitioner (Herber is a member of the Society of Genealogists in London), this complete, current, and beautiful guide ultimately helps the researcher focus on how the ancestral trail begins and how to form a coherent picture of past generations and their links to the present. Highly recommended. Howells's Netting Your Ancestors, on the other hand, is less elegant in delivering its guidance to genealogical research on the Internet. Nothing that it covers?the selection of hardware and software, getting a direct internet connection, E-mail, mailing lists, and newsgroups?is tied uniquely to genealogical research. In fact, a good 95 percent of the skills and tools it covers could be gleaned just as effectively from any basic computer book.

I was always amazed by their enthusiastic responses to the colors, shapes, subjects, and fascinating stories of the artists lives. It wasn't uncommon for us to spend an entire class period looking at and talking about just one work of art. By asking challenging questions, I prompted the children to examine and think very carefully about the art, and then quite naturally they would begin to ask all sorts of interesting questions of their own. These experiences inspired me to write this book and the other volumes in the <i>How Artists See</i> series.<br> <br> <i>How Artists See</i> is designed to teach children about the world by looking at art, and about art by looking at the world through the eyes of great artists. The books encourage children to look critically, answer&#x2014;and ask&#x2014;thought-provoking questions, and form an appreciation and understanding of an artist's vision. Each book is devoted to a single subject so that children can see how different artists have approached and treated the same theme and begin to understand the importance of individual style.<br> <br>Because I believe that children learn most successfully in an atmosphere of exploration and discovery, I've included questions that encourage them to formulate ideas and responses for themselves. And because peoples reactions to art are based on their own personal aesthetic, most of the questions are open-ended and have more than one answer. If you're reading aloud to your children or students, give them ample time to look at each work and form their own opinions; it certainly is not necessary to read the whole book in one sitting. Like a good book or movie, art can be enjoyed over and over again, each time with the possibility of revealing something that wasn't seen before.<br> <br>You may notice that dates and other historical information are not included in the main text. I purposely omitted this information in order to focus on the art and those aspects of the world it illustrates. For children who want to learn more about the artists whose works appear in the book, short biographies are provided at the end, along with suggestions for further reading and a list of museums where you can see additional works by each artist.<br> <br>After reading <i>How Artists See The Weather,</i> children can do a wide variety of related activities to extend and reinforce all that they've learned. In addition to the simple activities Ive suggested throughout the main text, they can make a paper-bag wind stocking decorated with crepe paper streamers, or plant easy-to-grow sunflower seeds in a bright part of the backyard or school grounds. Since the examples shown here are just a tiny fraction of the great works of art that feature the weather as their subject, children can go on a scavenger hunt through museums and the many wonderful art books in your local library to find more examples of weather images.<br> <br>I hope that you and your children or students will enjoy reading and rereading this book and, by looking at many styles of art, discover how artists share with us their unique ways of seeing and depicting our world.<br></p><h2>The Lucifer Gospel</h2><p>This fast-paced adventure about a hidden truth-or a devilish deception-will thrill fans of the Da Vinci Code...or Indiana Jones!

It is a comprehensive work that not only challenges preconceptions of contemporary garden design, but provides fresh ideas and inspiration to garden owners everywhere.</p></p><p></p><h2>Know That What You Eat You Are: The Best Food Writing from Harper&#39;s Magazine (The American Retrospective Series)</h2><p><p>This collection of food writing from the archives of <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i><i>Magazine</i> demonstrates that Americans have been thinking and caring about what and how they eat for more than a century and a half.</p><p>The essays in <i>Know That What You Eat You Are</i> have been selected from <i>Harper&#x2019;s Magazine&#x2019;s</i> 167-year history and feature such celebrated writers as M.F.K.

There are chilling accounts of efforts to innovate new foods (Fritos, for instance) and preserve them for the late 20th century&#x2019;s burgeoning consumer culture. There are stories of foods coldly regarded as mere commodities (hello, Quinoa) and others that expound on how ensuring that we eat good, healthy food is a responsibility we all share. One of the latest pieces in the book is a hilarious crawl though the excess and absurdity of early 21st century dining in New York City that will have readers laughing deeply from their bellies while wondering if they might desire to fill it with an inflated pig&#x2019;s bladder.

This book&#39;s copyright is 1971. From the Introduction: &#34;Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit was Professor Knight&#39;s doctoral dissertation. It is one of the two dissertations - the other is Irving Fisher&#39;s - written before World War I which are still a part of the living literature of general economic theory.&#34;</p><p>A timeless classic of economic theory that remains fascinating and pertinent today, this is Frank Knight&#39;s famous explanation of why perfect competition cannot eliminate profits, the important differences between &#34;risk&#34; and &#34;uncertainty,&#34; and the vital role of the entrepreneur in profitmaking. Based on Knight&#39;s PhD dissertation, this 1921 work, balancing theory with fact to come to stunning insights, is a distinct pleasure to read.Frank H. Knight (1885-1972) was a Professor of economics at the University of Chicago for most of his professional life. Considered one of the founding fathers of the intellectual current known as the Chicago School , Frank Knight had an enormous influence on economic theory and methodology and as a consequence also on the professional reach of modern economists. Knight was an editor of the pre-eminent Journal of Political Economy for over two decades, winner of half a dozen scholarly awards and honorary degrees.</p><h2>Edith Wharton: A Study of the Short Fiction (Twayne&#39;s Studies in Short Fiction)</h2><p>Edith Wharton, one of America's foremost women of letters, chronicled the glittering world of New York society in the early twentieth century. Her stories, collected in such volumes as The Greater Inclination (1899), The Descent of Man and Other Stories (1904), and Tales of Men and Ghosts (1910), scrutinize the moral decay beneath the glamorous facade of wealth and good manners. Although Wharton's sensibilities are closely aligned with Victorian literary tastes, she anticipated the spirit of the 1920s in her use of fallible narrators. Her writing set the stage for the coming generation of modernist writers.<br>Barbara A. White examines Wharton's short fiction from a contemporary feminist perspective, arguing that her work can best be understood in terms of her biography. Suggesting that Wharton was probably the victim of incest, White demonstrates how this terrible experience deeply affected her life and art. White also analyzes Wharton's criticism of social convention, particularly her treatment of the institution of marriage. Closing with selections from Wharton's own writings and from other prominent critics, this provocative study illuminates the psychological complexity and astute social observation inherent in Wharton's work. Edith Wharton: A Study of the Short Fiction is certain to be a seminal work in Wharton studies.</p><p></p><h2>An American Spy: A Novel (Milo Weaver, 3)</h2><p><p>"Another must-read from the best novelist working today in the tradition of John le Carr�." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred)</p><p>In Olen Steinhauer's bestseller, <i>The Tourist</i>, reluctant CIA agent Milo Weaver uncovered a conspiracy linking the Chinese government to the highest reaches of the American intelligence community, including his own Department of Tourism&#x2015;the most clandestine department in the Company.

Visit OlenSteinhauer.com.AN AMERICAN SPY (CHAPTER 1)<p>The time Xin Zhu spent trying to be unheard could have added up to an entire life. Hours driving extra laps through a city, watching the rearview; accumulated minutes gazing into street-window reflections and standing in queues for bread or soup he didn&#x2019;t even want because his stomach was in knots. Sitting behind desks, thinking through cover stories and diversions and wondering how long ago his office was last scoured for bugs. Visits to cemeteries and bars and churches and empty warehouses and parking garages, only to find that his date wasn&#x2019;t going to show up. Meals lost sitting for hours in dark rooms, in airports and train stations and wet public squares, waiting.</p><p>Then today, driving the dull hour and a half from Beijing to Nankai along the G020, ditching his ten-year-old Audi and taking a taxi to the train station in tree-lined Xiqing. Waiting on the platform until the Qingdao train started to roll before heaving his large body and small gray overnight bag onto the last car. Hovering in the doorway as the station passed, watching for latecomers. All this, even though this same train began life in south Beijing, not so far from where his journey began. All this, just to meet someone who, like him, lived and worked in Beijing.</p><p>The story, which his assistant could be depended on to proliferate, was that Xin Zhu was on a weekend trip to Shanghai to gain 665 miles of perspective and consider his dwindling options. By the time the masters in Beijing realized&#x2014;if they realized&#x2014;that the big, silent man checking into Shanghai&#x2019;s Pudong Shangri-La was not Xin Zhu, it would be too late.</p><p>As the train headed southeast on its five-hour itinerary, he worked his way toward the front. He was a conspicuously fat man, and when he came upon others either he or they had to squeeze into a spare seat to allow space to pass. Newspapers, covered with photos of devastation&#x2014;Sichuan province, annihilation by earthquake&#x2014;were folded noisily to let him by. Occasionally, when coming upon young women with children, he offered a smile of sympathy as he raised his bag above his head, and they wedged themselves past each other. Finally, he found a pair of free seats in the front row of a clean, beige-paneled car. Zhu lifted the armrest between them and settled down gratefully before spotting more photos on more newspapers, rubble and weeping.</p><p>There was no other subject in the country, which almost made him feel guilty for this excursion. Four days ago, an earthquake had struck Wenchuan, in eastern Sichuan province, powerful enough to be felt more than a thousand miles away in the capital. The nation had mobilized. Nearly a hundred thousand soldiers were deployed, two thousand Health Ministry medical staff, a hundred and fifty aircraft. The confirmed dead totaled twenty thousand, but the published estimate was at least fifty thousand, which was probably low. In the face of that, what did the future of one fat spy matter?</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>As he waited for his breathing to ebb and the fine layer of sweat over his blunt features to evaporate, the ash-colored outskirts of Xiqing passed. The air was better here, and would only grow cleaner as they neared the coast. He, too, felt cleaner, being out of the capital. He always felt better in the field.</p><p>The conductor, a pleasant-looking woman in an immaculate blue uniform, darkened when he said that he wanted to buy a ticket from her. &#x201c;You boarded with no ticket?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Last-minute change in plans. I had no choice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We always have a choice.&#x201d;</p><p>He could have ended the discussion by producing his Guoanbu ID, but instead he said, &#x201c;My choice was to board the train or let my mother die.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll die if she doesn&#x2019;t see your face?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Qingdao hospital is out of blood. She&#x2019;ll die if I don&#x2019;t give her mine.&#x201d;</p><p>He could tell from her eyes that she didn&#x2019;t believe him&#x2014;at least, she didn&#x2019;t <i>want</i> to believe him. She finally said, &#x201c;You think you can move into one seat?&#x201d;</p><p>Zhu opened his hands to display his girth. &#x201c;Plainly impossible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;ll have to pay for two seats.&#x201d;</p><p>She was modern in her hairstyle and speech, but Zhu recognized her lineage in the millions of petty dictators China had produced during the Cultural Revolution. Rules as badges, laws as weapons. He said, &#x201c;Then I will pay for two seats,&#x201d; and reached for his wallet.</p><p>As the hours and the sinking landscape passed, he tried to put both Wenchuan and his personal troubles out of his head and watched the young couples that boarded and disembarked at each stop. They looked nothing like the peasant couples of his youth&#x2014;they had clean teeth, fine clothes, modest jewelry, cell phones, and the sparkle of life about them, as if they could very clearly see what tomorrow looked like and were undeterred. He admired such optimism, even as the newspapers denied it with grisly photographs of collapsed buildings and helmeted workers digging through rubble to find corpses. The whole nation, perhaps the whole world, was watching as hope faded, and Xin Zhu was riding a train to the coast, rather than westward, to work alongside the volunteers. The first step toward helping others, he reflected with only a touch of self-consciousness, is to ensure your own survival.</p><p>As they left Jinan, one of his cell phones buzzed. &#x201c;Shen An-ling,&#x201d; he said into it, his tone one of a man on vacation, &#x201c;Shanghai is beautiful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;ve heard, Xin Zhu,&#x201d; came his assistant&#x2019;s thin voice. &#x201c;I have also heard that, while you&#x2019;ve checked into the hotel, you&#x2019;ve barricaded yourself in the room. Might I suggest taking in the sights?&#x201d;</p><p>Shen An-ling was pushing the cover a little too hard, which meant that he wasn&#x2019;t alone. &#x201c;For the thinking I have to do, distractions will just get in the way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nature, time, and patience are the three great physicians,&#x201d; Shen An-ling said, banally&#x2014;and uncharacteristically&#x2014;quoting proverb. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think it can be rushed. You should get some air.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll open the window. Is the office running smoothly?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been honored by a visit from Yang Qing-Nian.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course&#x2014;Yang Qing-Nian, the right hand of Wu Liang. Who else would have asked why Xin Zhu was not leaving his hotel room? &#x201c;Does he bring good news from the Supervision and Liaison Committee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He brings good wishes&nbsp;... and a request for you to visit the committee at nine o&#x2019;clock on Monday morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I look forward to it,&#x201d; Zhu said with as much conviction as he could muster. &#x201c;Make sure Yang Qing-Nian is comfortable. The best tea for Yang Qing-Nian.&#x201d;</p><p>His thoughts now utterly derailed, he hung up and took from his bag a small box of rice balls his young wife had prepared. He began to eat them, one by one, imagining Yang Qing-Nian in his Haidian District office, sniffing and touching everything, storing every detail away for his report to Wu Liang. <i>The place is a mess. They work like English clerks, noses to their screens. Stuffy, no open windows, and it stinks of cigarettes and peanut sauce. The place could do with a good cleaning.</i></p><p>The irony was that Yang Qing-Nian and his master, Wu Liang, believed that they, in themselves, were enough to inspire fear. They believed that the appearance of Yang Qing-Nian, or anyone from the Ministry of Public Security, the domestic intelligence service, could throw him off his game, or leave him worrying all weekend in Shanghai about a Monday morning scolding. Were they his only worry, he actually would be in Shanghai, at a rooftop bar, enjoying a cognac and a Hamlet. Instead, all he could do now was ask a passing uniformed girl for one of her overpriced bottles of water.</p><p>It was nearly five when they pulled into Qingdao Station, which had been renovated for the Olympic boating competitions that would descend in the coming months. As he wandered the platform, bumping into hunched men lighting cigarettes, he gazed up at the freshly ubiquitous spiderweb ceiling of steel and glass. How much had it cost? With all the bribes and evictions that had riddled the great cities&#x2019; expensive facelifts, no one knew for sure. Then, across the hall, he saw a long but orderly queue leading to a temporary Red Cross counter, handing over donations. Yesterday, the newspapers reported that donations for the earthquake victims had reached 1.3 billion yuan. Zhu walked toward the counter, paused, then approached a wet-faced old woman near the front of the line and gave her ten hundred-yuan notes, about 150 dollars, to add to her offering. She was speechless.</p><p>Outside, a bright late-afternoon sun was tempered by the Yellow Sea breeze. He set down his bag, took out a cigar tin, and lit a filtered Hamlet before joining a crowd of young people crossing Feixian Road. They passed two bright, packed restaurants&#x2014;Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald&#x2019;s&#x2014;on their way to Bathing Beach #6. The teenagers raised their voices and hurried down to the water, while he remained on the sidewalk, smoking and watching their lean, young bodies prance across the sand and dive into the sea.</p><p>Though his own people had been from the mountains, he had always felt sympathy for coastal people. They shared the pragmatic objectivity of their mountain brothers. He watched the out-of-towners flop in the water while the stoic locals looked on and sold them fried things from steaming carts.</p><p>The #501 bus was half empty, and he took a pair of seats in the back for the hour-long journey. An entire life could be filled doing these things.</p><p>The sun was low in the west when he got out in front of a high-rise on a broad avenue in Laoshan, at the foot of Laoshan Mountain. He was one of five passenger...</p></p><h2>Everyone Makes Mistakes: Featuring Jim Henson&#39;s Sesame Street Muppets</h2><p>Big Bird&#39;s embarrassment at knocking down a clothesline of clean clothes causes him to invent some outrageous excuses before he decides to tell the truth.</p><p></p><h2>Guided Tours of Hell: Novellas</h2><p>Two novellas--&#34;Guided Tours of Hell&#34; and &#34;Three Pigs in Five Days&#34;--examine the difficulty of feeling the appropriate emotions about the greatest historical tragedy or the smallest personal sorrow</p><p>These two novellas about Americans abroad combine to create one wallop of a book. As they confront the legacy of history and their own shortcomings, Prose's characters are obsessively self-aware, even narcissistically petty--just like we are. In the title story, Landau, a struggling playwright, engages in a vanity-laden struggle of wills with a charismatic Holocaust-survivor in the cafeteria of a death camp-turned-tourist-attraction during a Kafka symposium. In the second novella "Three Pigs in Five Days," Nina is sent to Paris by her boss and ex-lover to write an article about a whorehouse-turned-hotel. While there, she is plagued by the demons of her erotic past as well as the romantic ghosts of the dysfunctional relationships of dead Parisian artists and their mistresses. Always harrowing, occasionally baroque, and tinged with hilarity, <b>Guided Tours of Hell</b> is an early candidate for the best fiction of the year.Francine Prose has taught at the Iowa Writers&#39; Workshop, the Sewanee Writers&#39; Conference, and Johns Hopkins University.</p><h2>City Observed: Los Angeles</h2><p>Charles Moore&#39;s classic is in turn knowledgeable, warm, witty, and slightly irreverent.

Here he reviews his life to date with the able assistance of McCarthy ( Women Coming of Age ), reprising some of the material in his earlier book, Giant Steps , but concentrating on his final season, a triumphal tour of all the NBA cities. The former star writes of his heroes--among them Jackie Robinson and UCLA coach John Wooden--opponents he has faced, like Larry Bird, such teammates as Magic Johnson, and the problems created by racial discrimination for blacks in general and black athletes in particular. Photos not seen by PW. Author tour. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book is a diary of Abdul-Jabbar's final season with the Los Angeles Lakers. Designated as the legendary center's "farewell tour," it provided fans in every National Basketball Association city with the opportunity to honor him with a formal goodbye ceremony. At each stop Abdul-Jabbar resurrects and reflects upon memories of his many career milestones. However, except for a poignant description of a visit to his old New York City neighborhood and grade school and a scathing open letter to Wilt Chamberlain (a long-time critic of his play), the account is mostly subdued, similar in tone to his Giant Steps ( LJ 12/1/83).

They shared the same blue eyes, strong cheekbones, and full mouth, but whenever Bennie looked at Alice Connelly, all she could see were their differences. Tonight, Bennie had on a khaki suit, white shirt, and brown pumps, her lawyer uniform. Alice had on tight shorts with a low-cut black top, flaunting cleavage that Bennie didn&#x2019;t even know they had. She made a mental note to look down her shirt, after she got home.<br>Alice was making dinner and she opened the oven door, releasing the aroma of roasting chicken. &#x201c;Finally, it&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Smells great.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You sound surprised.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; Bennie changed the subject. &#x201c;I like your new house, it&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, right.&#x201d; Alice turned, carving fork in hand. &#x201c;Why are you being so condescending?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You are, too. It&#x2019;ll look better when I move all my stuff in, and the rent is low, since the estate can&#x2019;t sell it. That&#x2019;s the only way I could afford it. I don&#x2019;t have your money.&#x201d;<br>Bennie let it go. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good that it came furnished.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This crap? It&#x2019;s dead people furniture.&#x201d; Alice pushed back a smooth strand of hair, yet another difference between them. She blew-dry her hair straight, and her eyeliner was perfect. Bennie let her hair curl naturally and thought ChapStick was makeup.<br>She sipped her wine, feeling warm. There was no air-conditioning, and the kitchen was small and spare except for knobby wooden chairs and a dark wood table. A greenish glass fixture gave little light, and cracks zigzagged down the plaster like summer lightning. Still the cottage had a rustic charm, especially set in the rolling countryside of southeastern Pennsylvania, an hour or so outside of Philadelphia.<br>Alice plopped the chicken on the table, then sat down. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t panic, it&#x2019;s organic.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re eating healthy now, huh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What do you mean? I always did. So, are you dating anybody?&#x201d; Alice asked.<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How long&#x2019;s it been since you got laid?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nice talk.&#x201d; Bennie bit into a potato, which tasted good. &#x201c;If I remembered sex, I&#x2019;d miss it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whatever happened to that lawyer you lived with? What was his name again?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Grady Wells.&#x201d; Bennie felt a pang. She&#x2019;d get over Grady, any decade now.<br>&#x201c;So what happened?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t work out.&#x201d; Bennie ate quickly. It had taken forever to get here from Philly, in rush-hour traffic. She wouldn&#x2019;t get home until midnight, which wasn&#x2019;t the way she wanted to end an exhausting week.<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;d you see after Grady?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nobody serious.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So he&#x2019;s the one that got away?&#x201d;<br>Bennie kept her head down, hiding her expression. She couldn&#x2019;t understand how Alice always intuited so much about her. They&#x2019;d never lived together, even as babies, though Alice claimed to have memories from the womb. Bennie couldn&#x2019;t even remember where she put her car keys.<br>&#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s new in your life? Don&#x2019;t give me the official version. I read the website.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing but work. How about you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m seeing a few nice guys, and I&#x2019;m working out. I even joined a gym.&#x201d; Alice made a muscle of her slim arm. &#x201c;See?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Bennie had been an elite rower in her time, but she&#x2019;d been too busy lately to exercise. &#x201c;By the way, I hear great things about the job you&#x2019;re doing at PLG. Karen thinks you&#x2019;re terrific.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you keeping tabs on me, now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not. I ran into her, at a benefit.&#x201d;<br>Alice arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;Does she have to report to you just because you got me the job?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, but if I see her, we talk. She knows me, like she knows most of the bar association. She has to, we all support the Public Law Group.&#x201d; Bennie felt a headache coming on. She&#x2019;d lost a motion in court this morning, and it was turning out to be the high point of her day.<br>&#x201c;So what did she say, exactly? She loves to gossip.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t like that.&#x201d; Bennie sipped her wine, but it didn&#x2019;t help. &#x201c;All she said was that they like you. They have you doing office administration, payroll, and personnel, in addition to the paralegal work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not anymore. I quit.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Bennie said, blind-sided. &#x201c;You quit PLG? When?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The other day. It wasn&#x2019;t for me, and the money sucked.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you have to start somewhere.&#x201d; Bennie couldn&#x2019;t hide her dismay. She&#x2019;d stuck her neck out for Alice and now her friends at PLG would be left in the lurch. &#x201c;They would have promoted you, in time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When, ten years?&#x201d; Alice rolled her eyes. &#x201c;The work was boring, and the people were so freaking annoying. I&#x2019;d rather work with you, at Rosato &amp; Associates.&#x201d;<br>Bennie&#x2019;s mouth went dry. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine Alice at her firm. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need a paralegal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can answer phones.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I already have a receptionist.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So fire her ass.&#x201d;<br>Bennie felt cranky. Maybe it was the headache, which was a doozy. &#x201c;I like her. I would never do that to her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not even for me? We&#x2019;re the only family we have.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Bennie tried to keep a civil tongue. Being her sister&#x2019;s keeper was getting old. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t fire her. I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay, fine, then think outside the box. You need somebody to run the office, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I run the office.&#x201d;<br>Alice snorted. &#x201c;If you ask me, you could use a hand with personnel. Those girls who work for you need a life lesson, especially the little one, Mary DiNunzio. Time for girlfriend to grow up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true.&#x201d; Bennie wished she hadn&#x2019;t come. Her stomach felt queasy. Her appetite had vanished. She set down her fork. &#x201c;DiNunzio&#x2019;s a good lawyer. She should make partner next month.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whatever, then I&#x2019;ll be your assistant. I&#x2019;ll take ninety grand, to start.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Listen, I can&#x2019;t always be the solution to your problems.&#x201d; Bennie&#x2019;s head thundered. &#x201c;I got you a job, and you quit it. If you want another job, go out and find one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks, Mom.&#x201d; Alice smiled sourly. &#x201c;The economy&#x2019;s in the toilet, if you haven&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You should have thought of that before, and you&#x2019;ll find something, if you try. You went to college, and you have lots of . . . abilities and, oh, my head. . . .&#x201d; Suddenly the kitchen whirled like spin art, and Bennie collapsed onto the table. Her face landed on the edge of her dirty plate, and her hand upset her water glass.<br>&#x201c;Aww, got a headache?&#x201d; Alice chuckled. &#x201c;Too bad.&#x201d;<br>Bennie didn&#x2019;t know what was happening. She felt impossibly drunk. Her eyes wouldn&#x2019;t stay open.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a fool. You think I&#x2019;d really want to work for you?&#x201d;<br>Bennie tried to lift her head up, but couldn&#x2019;t. All her strength had left her body. Sound and colors swirled together.<br>&#x201c;Give it up. It&#x2019;s over.&#x201d;<br>Bennie watched, helpless, as darkness descended.<br>Excerpted from Think Twice by .<br>Copyright � 2010 by Lisa Scottoline.<br>Published in March 2010 by Roaring Brook Press.<br>All rights reserved.

Soviet police state.<p><b>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</b>, winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature, was born in 1918. In February 1945, while he was captain of a reconnaissance battery of the Soviet Army, he was arrested and sentenced to an eight-year term in a labor camp and permanent internal exile, which was cut short by Khrushchev's reforms, allowing him to return from Kazakhstan to Central Russia in 1956. Although permitted to publish <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</i> in 1962--which remained his only full-length work to have appeared in his homeland until 1990--Solzhenitsyn was by 1969 expelled from the Writers' Union. The publication in the West of his other novels and, in particular, of <i>The Gulag Archipelago,</i> brought retaliation from the authorities. In 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested, stripped of his Soviet citizenship, and forcibly flown to Frankfurt. Solzhenitsyn and his wife and children moved to the United States in 1976. In September 1991, the Soviet government dismissed treason charges against him; Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia in 1994.

Now, straight from the pages of this well-loved periodical, The Well-Lived Life presents a lavish chronicle of a country and a culture coming into its own, documenting America's continuing education in matters of house, home and garden over the course of the twentieth century. Selecting high points from the magazine, this book surveys the growing confidence and imagination reflected in American interiors and entertaining over the last century - the dinners, picnics and parties of a country dedicated to welcoming others - and the changing definition of home. It also illuminates the joys - sedentary or sporting - Americans have always found in the out-of-doors. The Well-Lived Life surveys the landscape of our lawns and gardens, from rigid formality to wild, blowsy beauty, and takes a close look at blooms and their ability to charm, seduce, amaze and inspire. It also travels to the places we build to get away from it all - the cabins, cottages and summer palaces where we shed the formality and stress of everyday life. Above all, this volume illustrates the abiding affection we have for how and where we make our lives. Featuring such legendary photographers as Irving Penn, Horst P.

Dell, then an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, drove away from his parents' Houston home in a white BMW he'd bought selling subscriptions to his hometown newspaper. In the backseat were three personal computers. <p> Today, he is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dell Computer Corporation, an $18 billion company, the second-largest manufacturer and marketer of computers in the world. Founded on a deceptively simple premise--to deliver high-performance computer systems directly to the end user--Dell Computer is the envy of its competition, constantly growing at five times the industry rate, and a perennial darling of Wall Street: its stock is up more than 36,000 percent this decade, and more than 200 percent in the last year. </p><p> In <em> Direct From Dell,</em> Michael Dell himself tells the incredible story of Dell Computer's successful rise, beginning in his college dorm room with $1,000 in capital. </p><p> In these pages, you'll see the formation of a great visionary--and a great company. You'll meet the young Dell who, at the tender age of eight, had already begun looking "to eliminate unnecessary steps" and who, as a numbers-loving adolescent, was inspired by a newfound fascination with computers to save his money to buy a coveted Apple II--only to promptly take it apart. You'll encounter a young visionary who, upon witnessing the inefficiencies of an exploding industry, challenged conventional wisdom and set out to do nothing less than beat IBM at its own game. In so doing, Dell forever changed the way things "had always been done" in the computer industry. </p><p> You'll also see the birth of a Dell hallmark--the direct model--which, in its ability to reach the customer directly, eliminated not only a substantial middleman markup but also the possibility of costly excess inventory, setting the stage for other extraordinary achievements. In an industry notorious for its unreliable service, Dell utilized its direct customer relationships to pioneer the concept of customer "support"--and didn't rest until the caliber of its service was rivaled only by the quality of its products and its speed of delivery. </p><p> But the story of Dell Computer is no fairy tale. Marked by uncharacteristically rapid growth, the company was faced with challenges that could have threatened its very existence. From forays into retail to under- (and over-) developed product lines, Dell learned some hard lessons along the way--and emerged stronger as a result. </p><p> The strategies born of those times--unrivaled speed to market; superior customer service; a fierce commitment to producing constantly high-quality custom-made systems--heralded what has perhaps been the company's crowning achievement: an early exploitation of the Internet. One of the first companies to actually make money online, Dell is now selling more than $12 million worth of systems per day over www.dell.com. </p><p> Not just for CEOs or those in high tech, the strategies revealed in <em>Direct From Dell</em> are invaluable to managers in a broad cross section of industries. From starting a successful business to pioneering computer sales and service over the Internet, Dell shares his perspectives on: </p><p></p><ul><li> Why it's infinitely better for any business starting out to have too little capital, rather than too much <p></p></li><li> How studying your customers--not your competition--will give you a greater competitive edge <p></p></li><li> Why it can be life-threatening to your company to pursue too many good ideas--or to grow too fast <p></p></li><li> Why it's essential to run a P&amp;L on every area of your business <p></p></li><li> Why your people prose a greater threat to the health of your business than your competition does <p></p></li><li> How you can exploit your competition's weakness by exposing its greatest strength <p></p></li><li> How integrating your business virtually can make the difference between being quick--and being dead</li></ul> <p> Revealing nothing less than a new model for doing business in the information age, <em>Direct From Dell</em> is both an extraordinary business success story and a manifesto for revolutionizing any industry.</p></p><p>The PC business is full of rags-to-riches stories. But perhaps none is as dramatic as the rise of Dell Computer. In <i>Direct from Dell</i>, founder and CEO Michael Dell tells how he started his company from a dorm room at the University of Texas with less than $1,000 and built it into an industry powerhouse with a market capitalization of well over $100 billion. What makes Dell Computer unique is not what it sells, but rather how it sells it. Dell was first in the PC industry to pioneer the direct-selling model, a method that competitors such as Compaq and Apple Computer are only now starting to embrace. By cutting out the intermediary and creating a direct link between manufacturer and customer, Dell was able to provide customers with computers that cost less and that were more apt to meet customer needs.<p> <i>Direct from Dell</i> is organized into two parts. The first recounts the history and the enormous growth of Dell Computer. The second part focuses on Dell's management approach, from developing customer focus to creating alliances with suppliers. The book manages to avoid most of the promotional and self-congratulatory air that seem to plague so many first-person CEO tomes. Anyone who has followed the PC industry or would like insight into Dell Computer's success should enjoy reading this book. Well written and easy to read. Recommended. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i></p><p>Michael Dell is the chairman of the board of directors of Dell Inc., the world's largest computer-systems company.

The CPU, memory, and keyboard are all attached to a unit with LED display and lights, so you can give the CPU instructions and see the contents of any register. This is further expanded by attaching various types of logic gates (geek-speak for certain types of circuits) which produce output based on input.

The title refers directly to that essence of Shakti, Hindu worship of the goddess - although hidden or veiled from the eyes of those caught up in everyday life, the brilliance of her wisdom cannot be kept from those who seek it out.</p><p><i>The Veiling Brilliance</i> tells the tale of three men--a king, a merchant, and a seer--but at its core is a revelation about the central tenets of goddess worship within an ancient religion. A humiliated king, Suratha, and a down-on-his-luck merchant, Samadhi, find themselves at the ashram of the seer Medhas. There, they receive the support and teaching they need to return successfully to the world at large, but each in a manner based on his own individual need.</p><p>This fascinating novel of attainment and redemption allows readers a rare glimpse into the world of traditional Hindu goddess worship through the gentle, teaching form of fiction. Follow the three main characters as they bond with each other and grow together in a quest for enlightenment that will allow the two students to emerge back into the world, healed and ready for the vicissitudes of secular life.</p></p><p><p>Devadatta Kali (David Nelson) began his long association with Hinduism in the 1960's and has been a lifelong adherent and promoter.

Edouard de Pomiane turned classic French cuisine on its head, stripping away complicated sauces and arcane techniques to reveal the essence of pure, unadorned good cooking. A food scientist, he offers lucid explanations for why food behaves as it does. Read him and the cream in your gratin dauphinois will never separate, your pot au feu will never be stringy, and your choux pastry will puff to astonishing proportions. Pomiane's great accomplishment was to restore confidence to the cook, and joy to the kitchen. Cooking with Pomiane spills over with amusing stories and more than three hundred superb and streamlined recipes; it is as much a delight to read as it is to cook from. This Modern Library edition is published with an Introduction by the renowned food writer Elizabeth David.<br></p><p>Gourmet, scientist, and cookbook writer of endearing prose, Edourad de Pomiane's revolutionary approach to French food and diet of his day involved sane, perceptive simplification--a distinctly modern tactic. <i>Cooking with Pomiane</i>, first published in the 1930s and reissued in the Modern Library Food series, encapsulates Pomiane's debunking methods: away with complicated techniques and elaborate sauces; in their place, find concise formulas that discover the essence of their ingredients and celebrate them in simple preparations. Though Pomiane provided precise, even scientific cooking rationales ("Everyone agrees that [fish] must be served [before] the meat course," he writes, "...but such as meal is far too rich in nitrogenous substances"), he is also a beguiling instructor. "Take a bunch of parsley," he advises, "the size of a bunch of violets." Any reader interested in cooking and its modern history will treasure the book.<p> Beginning with useful information for the host or hostess (for a dinner party, "one should prepare only one good dish," Pomiane advises sensibly), the book then presents over 300 recipes, arranged by course or type, and "a few drinks." Pomiane's revolutionary approach is embodied in his formula for Noodles with Mushrooms, which requires only noodles, mushrooms, butter, and grated Parmesan. Use good ingredients and you have a feast. Though he includes many, albeit streamlined, recipes from the classic canon, such as <i>Artichauts � la Barigoule</i> (artichokes braised with a ham, bread crumb, and onion stuffing), he also supplies recipes that were unconventional in his day, including Choucroute Salad and Piroshki. Readers will also want to prepare such treats as <i>Mousse au Chocolat</i> (chocolate, sugar, eggs, cream) and Pumpkin Gratin (pumpkin, almonds, sugar, an egg, and macaroons). With an introduction by Elizabeth David, the book provides a rare opportunity to meet and learn from an original cooking master. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>"Unburdened with excess detail but invariably embodying the vital touch of the artist....I know of no cookery writer who has a greater mastery of the captivating phrase."<i>&#x2014;Elizabeth David</i><br><br>"To prepare dinner for a friend is to put into the cooking pot all one's affection and good will, all one's gaiety and zest, so that after three hours cooking a waft of happiness escapes from beneath the lid."&#x2014;<i>Edouard de Pomiane</i><br></p><h2>The Lemon Table: Stories</h2><p>Master prose stylist Julian Barnes presents a collection of stories whose characters are growing old and facing the end of their lives -- some with bitterness, some with resignation and others with raging defiance.<br><br>&#x201c;Life is just a premature reaction to death,&#x201d; was what Viv&#x2019;s husband used to say. Once her lover and friend, he is now Viv&#x2019;s semi-helpless charge, who is daily sinking ever deeper into dementia. In &#x201c;Appetite,&#x201d; Viv has found a way to reach her husband: by reading aloud snippets of recipe books until he calls out indelible -- and sometimes unfortunate -- scenes locked away in his brain. In &#x201c;The Things You Know,&#x201d; two elderly friends enjoy their monthly breakfast meetings that neither would ever think of missing. Of course, all they really have in common is a fondness for flat suede shoes and a propensity for thinking spiteful, unspoken thoughts about one another&#x2019;s dead husbands. &#x201c;The Fruit Cage&#x201d; is narrated by a middle-aged man whose seemingly orderly upbringing is harrowingly undone when he discovers that his parents&#x2019; old age is not necessarily a time of serenity but actually an age of aroused, perhaps violent, passions.<br><br>In these stories, Julian Barnes displays the erudition, wit and uncanny insight into the human mind that mark him as one of today&#x2019;s great writers, one whose intellect and humour never obscure a genuine affection for his characters.</p><p>Julian Barnes is the award-winning author of nine novels, including <b>A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters</b> and <b>England, England</b>, which was shortlisted for the 1998 Booker Prize.

As if the phrase &#x201c;short back and sides, with a little bit off the top&#x201d; might mean something different in this new suburb. He&#x2019;d doubted it. Everything else seemed the same: the torture chair, the surgical smells, the strop and the folded razor&#x2014;folded not in safety but in threat. Most of all, the torturer-in-chief was the same, a loony with big hands who pushed your head down till your windpipe nearly snapped, who prodded your ear with a bamboo finger. &#x201c;General inspection, madam?&#x201d; he said greasily when he&#x2019;d finished. His mother had shaken off the effects of her magazine and stood up. &#x201c;Very nice,&#x201d; she said vaguely, leaning over him, smelling of stuff. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send him by himself next time.&#x201d; Outside, she had rubbed his cheek, looked at him with idle eyes, and murmured, &#x201c;You poor shorn lamb.&#x201d;<br><br>Now he was on his own. As he walked past the estate agent&#x2019;s, the sports shop and the half-timbered bank, he practised saying, &#x201c;Short back and sides with a little bit off the top.&#x201d; He said it urgently, without the comma; you had to get the words just right, like a prayer. There was one and threepence in his pocket; he stuffed his handkerchief in tighter to keep the coins safe. He didn&#x2019;t like not being allowed to be afraid. It was simpler at the dentist&#x2019;s: your mother always came with you, the dentist always hurt you, but afterwards he gave you a boiled sweet for being a good boy, and then back in the waiting room you pretended in front of the other patients that you were made of stern stuff. Your parents were proud of you. &#x201c;Been in the wars, old chap?&#x201d; his father would ask. Pain let you into the world of grown-up phrases. The dentist would say, &#x201c;Tell your father you&#x2019;re fit for overseas. He&#x2019;ll understand.&#x201d; So he&#x2019;d go home and Dad would say, &#x201c;Been in the wars, old chap?&#x201d; and he&#x2019;d answer, &#x201c;Mr. Gordon says I&#x2019;m fit for overseas.&#x201d;<br><br>He felt almost important going in, with the adult spring of the door against his hand. But the barber merely nodded, pointed with his comb to the line of high-backed chairs, and resumed his standing crouch over a white-haired geezer. Gregory sat down. His chair creaked. Already he wanted to pee. There was a bin of magazines next to him, which he didn&#x2019;t dare explore. He gazed at the hamster nests of hair on the floor.<br><br>When his turn came, the barber slipped a thick rubber cushion onto the seat. The gesture looked insulting: he&#x2019;d been in long trousers now for ten and a half months. But that was typical: you were never sure of the rules, never sure if they tortured everyone the same way, or if it was just you. Like now: the barber was trying to strangle him with the sheet, pulling it tight round his neck, then shoving a cloth down inside his collar. &#x201c;And what can we do for you today, young man?&#x201d; The tone implied that such an ignominious and deceitful woodlouse as he obviously was might have strayed into the premises for any number of different reasons.<br><br>After a pause, Gregory said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a haircut, please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;d say you&#x2019;d come to the right place, wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; The barber tapped him on the crown with his comb; not painfully, but not lightly either.<br><br>&#x201c;Short-back-and-sides-with-a-little-bit-off-the-top-please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now we&#x2019;re motoring,&#x201d; said the barber.<br><br>They would only do boys at certain times of the week. There was a notice saying No Boys on Saturday Mornings. Saturday afternoons they were closed anyway, so it might just as well read No Boys on Saturdays. Boys had to go when men didn&#x2019;t want to. At least, not men with jobs. He went at times when the other customers were pensioners. There were three barbers, all of middle age, in white coats, dividing their time between the young and the old. They greased up to these throat-clearing old geezers, made mysterious conversation with them, put on a show of being keen on their trade. The old geezers wore coats and scarves even in summer, and gave tips as they left. Gregory would watch the transaction out of the corner of his eye. One man giving another man money, a secret half-handshake with both pretending the exchange wasn&#x2019;t being made.<br><br>Boys didn&#x2019;t tip. Perhaps that was why barbers hated boys. They paid less and they didn&#x2019;t tip. They also didn&#x2019;t keep still. Or at least, their mothers told them to keep still, they kept still, but this didn&#x2019;t stop the barber bashing their heads with a palm as solid as the flat of a hatchet and muttering, &#x201c;Keep still.&#x201d; There were stories of boys who&#x2019;d had the tops of their ears sliced off because they hadn&#x2019;t kept still. Razors were called cut-throats. All barbers were loonies.<br><br>&#x201c;Wolf cub, are we?&#x201d; It took Gregory a while to realize that he was being addressed. Then he didn&#x2019;t know whether to keep his head down or look up in the mirror at the barber. Eventually he kept his head down and said, &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Boy scout already?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Crusader?&#x201d;<br><br>Gregory didn&#x2019;t know what that meant. He started to lift his head, but the barber rapped his crown with the comb. &#x201c;Keep still, I said.&#x201d; Gregory was so scared of the loony that he was unable to answer, which the barber took as a negative. &#x201c;Very fine organization, the Crusaders. You give it a thought.&#x201d;<br><br>Gregory thought of being chopped up by curved Saracen swords, of being staked out in the desert and eaten alive by ants and vultures. Meanwhile, he submitted to the cold smoothness of the scissors&#x2014;always cold even when they weren&#x2019;t. Eyes tight shut, he endured the tickly torment of hair falling on his face. He sat there, still not looking, convinced that the barber should have stopped cutting ages ago, except that he was such a loony he would probably carry on cutting and cutting until Gregory was bald. Still to come was the stropping of the razor, which meant that your throat was going to be cut; the dry, scrapy feel of the blade next to your ears and on the back of your neck; the fly-whisk shoved into your eyes and nose to get the hair out.<br><br>Those were the bits that made you wince every time. But there was also something creepier about the place. He suspected it was rude. Things you didn&#x2019;t know about, or weren&#x2019;t meant to know about, usually turned out to be rude. Like the barber&#x2019;s pole. That was obviously rude. The previous place just had an old bit of painted wood with colours twirling round it. The one here worked by electricity, and moved in whirly circles all the time. That was ruder, he thought. Then there was the binful of magazines. He was sure some of them were rude. Everything was rude if you wanted it to be. This was the great truth about life which he&#x2019;d only just discovered. Not that he minded. Gregory liked rude things.<br><br>Without moving his head, he looked in the next-door mirror at a pensioner two seats away. He&#x2019;d been yakking on in the sort of loud voice old geezers always had. Now the barber was bent over him with a small pair of round-headed scissors, cutting hairs out of his eyebrows. Then he did the same with his nostrils; then his ears. Snipping great twigs out of his lugholes. Absolutely disgusting. Finally, the barber started brushing powder into the back of the geezer&#x2019;s neck. What was that for?<br><br>Now the torturer-in-chief had the clippers out. That was another bit Gregory didn&#x2019;t like. Sometimes they used hand-clippers, like tin-openers, squeak grind squeak grind round the top of his skull till his brains were opened up. But these were the buzzer-clippers, which were even worse, because you could get electrocuted from them. He&#x2019;d imagined it hundreds of times. The barber buzzes away, doesn&#x2019;t notice what he&#x2019;s doing, hates you anyway because you&#x2019;re a boy, cuts a wodge off your ear, the blood pours all over the clippers, they get a short-circuit and you&#x2019;re electrocuted on the spot. Must have happened millions of times. And the barber always survived because he wore rubber-soled shoes.<br><br>At school they swam naked. Mr. Lofthouse wore a pouch-thing so they couldn&#x2019;t see his whanger. The boys took off all their clothes, had a shower for lice or verrucas or something, or being smelly in the case of Wood, then jumped into the pool. You leaped up high and landed with the water hitting your balls. That was rude, so you didn&#x2019;t let the master see you doing it. The water made your balls all tight, which made your willy stick out more, and afterwards they towelled themselves dry and looked at one another without looking, sort of sideways, like in the mirror at the barber&#x2019;s. Everyone in the class was the same age, but some were still bald down there; some, like Gregory, had a sort of bar of hair across the top but nothing on their balls; and some, like Hopkinson and Shapiro, were as hairy as men already, and a darker colour, brownish, like Dad&#x2019;s when he&#x2019;d peeped round the side of a stand-up. At least he had some hair, not like Baldy Bristowe and Hall and Wood. But how did Hopkinson and Shapiro get like that? Everyone else had willies; Hopkinson and Shapiro already had whangers.<br><br>He wanted to pee. He couldn&#x2019;t. He mustn&#x2019;t think about peeing. He could hold out till he got home. The Crusaders fought the Saracens and delivered the Holy Land from the Infidel. Like Infidel Castro, sir? That was one of Wood&#x2019;s jokes. They wore crosses on their surcoats. Chainmail must have been hot in Israel. He must stop thinking that he could win a gold medal in a peeing-high-against-a-wall competition.<br><br>&#x201c;Local?&#x201d; said the barber suddenly. Gregory looked at him in the mirror for th...</p><h2>How to Live a Life of Prayer: Classic Christian Writers on the Divine Privilege of Prayer</h2><p><p><b>Everybody wants to live a life of prayer&#x2014;but how? </b><br><br> The words of classic Christian writers still speaks to us today, addressing the questions and concerns we have about prayer.

When her mother disappears, Melanie must follow her to Half World?and neither of them may return alive. Imagine Coraline as filmed by the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki (Howl?s Moving Castle), or Neil Gaiman collaborating with Charles de Lint. Half World is vivid, visceral, unforgettable, a combination of prose and images that will haunt you.</p><p>Hiromi Goto won the James Tiptree Jr. Award for her adult novel <i>The Kappa Child</i>. She lives in Canada.<br><br> Jillian Tamaki , co-creator of the multiple award-winning graphic novel <i>Skim</i>, lives in Brooklyn, New York.Grade 7 Up&#x2014;A prophecy tells that only a child born of the lifeless Half World can reunite the three worlds of Flesh, Spirit, and the Half World that have been split asunder. Enter Melanie Tamaki, fleeing from some school bullies. She arrives home to find that her mother, bedridden when she left for school, is mysteriously gone. Melanie receives a creepy phone call from someone demanding that she go to the "Half World" or else her mother will be hurt. She turns to elderly Mrs. Wei for help and, from her, hears of the prophecy. Mrs. Wei feeds her and gives her a pendant of a jade rat. So fortified, Melanie sets off on her quest. Her mother has collected the artwork of Escher and Bosch and, upon arrival in Half World, Melanie begins to understand why. In this world literally bereft of color every being is grotesque, most barely recognizable as human at all. Cast among these horrors, Melanie must remain hidden until she can rescue her mother and somehow save the three realms. Goto has created an unusual fantasy horror novel that's something like a Gaiman tale with a dash of Asian magic. Readers who want a different kind of fantasy and who like a villain who makes the skin crawl should enjoy this quick read. It's a rare treat and belongs in most YA collections.&#x2014;<i>Eric Norton, McMillan Memorial Library, Wisconsin Rapids, WI</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

Indeed, it is now attracting greater attention among research workers and being taught increasingly to students of zoology and veterinary science.<br> This book presents a readable overview of the behavior of the domestic cat, adopting both a mechanistic and functional approach, but making full reference to the scientific literature. The first half of the book is concerned mainly with physiological, developmental and psychological aspects, while the second half looks at social behavior, relationships with humans and welfare. The final chapter, written by well-known behavior therapist Peter Neville, considers problem behaviors. This book will appeal both to students and research workers, but will also interest members of the general public seeking a scientific but jargon-free approach to this fascinating subject.</p><p>John W.

Jan Vansina provides a critique of the history recorded by early missionaries and court historians and provides a bottom-up view, drawing on hundreds of grassroots narratives.

R. Giddings. The men who enlisted in the Twenty-Ninth OVI were, according to its lore, handpicked to ensure each was as pure in his antislavery beliefs as its founder. Whether these soldiers would fight harder than other soldiers, and whether the people of their hometowns would remain devoted to the ideals of the regiment, were questions that could only be tested by the experiment of war.<br><br><i>The Untried Life</i> is the story of these men from their very first regimental formation in a county fairground to the devastation of Gettysburg and the march to Atlanta and back again, enduring disease and Confederate prisons. It brings to vivid life the comradeship and loneliness that pervaded their days on the march. Dozens of unforgettable characters emerge, animated by their own letters and diaries: Corporal Nathan Parmenter, whose modest upbringing belies the eloquence of his writings; Colonel Lewis Buckley, one of the Twenty-Ninth&#x2019;s most charismatic officers; and Chaplain Lyman Ames, whose care of the sick and wounded challenged his spiritual beliefs. <br><br><i>The Untried Life</i> shows how the common soldier lived�&#x2014;his entertainments, methods of cooking, medical treatment, and struggle to maintain family connections�&#x2014;and separates the facts from the mythology created in the decades after the war. </p></p><p><p><b>James T.

From their founding in 1869, through their commitment to timekeeping excellence in the early 20th century, to their development of many wonderful Art Deco/Moderne-inspired wristwatches in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, Illinois was a leader in its field. Today their watches are highly sought after by collectors, both for their engineering and beauty. Here is the history of the company covered in great detail and with solid research. Included are historical documents, vintage photographs of the people and manufacturing processes at the Illinois Factory, old advetisements, and a compendium of their wristwatch production from their beginning until their sale to Hamilton Watch Company. But the best part for the collector and historian alike is a visual record of nearly every wristwatch design ever created by Illinois Watch Company, and their variations, in beautiful full color photographs. Each is accompanied by complete information about the watch and its production. In addition, scattered through the book are historical references that place the Company&#x2019;s evolution in the context of the general history of the period, and notes about the collectors of these fine timepieces and the adventures they have had in pursuit of them. Taken together this is an exciting and informative new volume for those who appreciate and cherish old timepieces.</p><p>Fred Friedberg was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey and graduated from Rutgers, The State University and earned a Juris Doctorate degree from the Washington College of Law at the American University in Washington, D.C.

"Hmm. Well,Angel, you did it up right this time." Tracing the X ray of Angel's left shoulder with an index finger, Elizabeth turned to look at her assistant. "Your biceps tendon is inflamed. You have tendonitis. Congratulations."</p> <p>"Damn..."</p> <p>"Yeah, no kidding," Elizabeth said, quirking her lips. "You know what that means?" "That you're gonna give me an anti&#x2013;inflammatory shot to ease my considerable pain, so I stop acting like an irritable pit bull. Right?"</p> <p>Grinning, Elizabeth turned off the light box and put the two X rays into a large folder that had Angel's name at the top. The dispensary shook and trembled as two Apache helicopter gunships began powering up for takeoff. The whole Black Jaguar operation was hidden in a cave complex within a mountain fifty miles from the archeological wonder Machu Picchu, and the picturesque tourist town of Agua Caliente. The alarm had rung earlier, which meant the two pilot crews on duty would be intercepting a drug shipment flight somewhere near Peru's border with Bolivia.</p> <p>"I'm going to save the squadron from my bad mood," Angel said once the trembling had subsided. "I'll bet I get written up for a commendation on it."</p> <p>"Very funny,Angel," Elizabeth said, rummaging in another cabinet. "Even the Angel of Death looks like death warmed over," she continued, casting a grin at her faithful assistant, a paramedic with the Peruvian army. Angel held her left arm guardedly against her body, her right hand cradling it. "Sorry, bad pun. I couldn't help myself," Elizabeth murmured sympathetically as she filled a syringe with the pain&#x2013;relieving drug she knew Angel needed.</p> <p>"I'm no crybaby, Doc, not even at a time like this. I'm one hundred percent Incan Indian," she muttered defiantly. Her ancestors were known for their ability to handle pain.</p> <p>Though she tried to rise to the occasion, Angel didn't have her usual spunk and feistiness, Elizabeth realized as she flicked her finger against the syringe and approached her colleague. "Hey, you're in a lotta pain. It shows."</p> <p>Angel eyed Elizabeth, the only physician on staff at BJS. They'd been teamed up together nearly three and a half years and worked like a well&#x2013;oiled machine. "Dude, I never knew an inflamed tendon could make me throw up and then pass out."</p> <p>"Hmm, well, pain can do those things to you. You just lifted one heavy box of supplies too many from that Blackhawk helicopter, and did your tendon in." She moved to Angel's bared left shoulder. Elizabeth had had to cut away the patient's T&#x2013;shirt to examine her injury earlier, when one of the crew had brought Angel in on a gurney, passed out.</p> <p>"This is so humiliating...." Angel watched as Elizabeth lifted the needle in her direction. "What are you gonna do? Put the needle right into that inflamed tendon? Am I gonna pass out from pain again?"</p> <p>Cupping her shoulder gently, Elizabeth murmured, "Relax. I'm the best shot&#x2013;giver on the face of the earth. This won't hurt, I promise...."</p> <p>Angel sucked in a breath and shut her eyes tightly. She barely felt the prick of the needle. And just as Elizabeth had promised, there was no pain.</p> <p>"There," her friend murmured, pleased with her efforts as she gently swabbed the area with a cotton ball drenched in alcohol. "All over."</p> <p>"And relief from this gutting pain is right around the corner, right, Doc?" Angel asked weakly.</p> <p>"Yep." Dropping the syringe into the designated wastebasket, Elizabeth pulled off her latex gloves and dropped them in there as well.</p> <p>"What does this mean? How long am I gonna be laid up and useless?"</p> <p>"Well, you've really injured that tendon, but by resting your shoulder and not lifting heavy items and limiting your mobility, I think in four to six weeks you'll be back in the saddle again."</p> <p>Eyes widening, Angel gasped. "What? Four weeks?"</p> <p>"I said four to six weeks." Elizabeth turned to her and studied her dark brown eyes, which were filled with worry. She handed Angel another dark green T&#x2013;shirt and helped her get it on. "Four would be minimum. And even if it is completely healed in that time, you're looking at occupational therapy exercises to regain and support the muscles around that tendon. You also&#x2014;" she patted Angel's other shoulder gently "&#x2014;need to learn your weightlifting limits. And how to lift in order to never have this happen again. Next time&#x2014;" she held Angel's mutinous stare "&#x2014;it may mean surgery or partial loss of mobility in your arm. Now, that's enough of a death sentence that it should make even you&#x2013;the Peruvian superwoman&#x2014;think about the consequences. And I know that look, Angel. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking you're going to heal up in a jiffy and be back at work in a week. It isn't gonna happen, so get over it and roll with this one&#x2014;the right way."</p> <p>"B&#x2013;but...what about you? I'm the only paramedic at BJS. You<i> need</i> me, Doc. You can't get along without me. What are you gonna do? You can't handle this place by yourself, and I can't be a one&#x2013;armed paramedic. What if one of our Apaches gets fired on by a Kamov Black Shark drug helo, and pilots get wounded? You're gonna need my help."</p> <p>"I know...."</p> <p>Opening her good hand, desperation in her tone, Angel added, "You gotta get a stand&#x2013;in&#x2014;a temporary paramedic&#x2014;up here."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>Morosely, Angel looked around the quiet dispensary. The aluminum Quonset hut sat at the very back of the huge lava cave that housed the entire black ops base. "Dude, this sucks."</p> <p>"You said it, Angel." Elizabeth gave her a slight smile. "Listen, I'm authorizing you four weeks of sick leave. I want you to go back to the barracks and rest. Put a hot pack on that shoulder from time to time and alternate it with an ice pack. Rest, sleep, drink plenty of water, and leave that shoulder alone. Don't pick up anything with that arm, you hear?"</p> <p>Glumly, Angel looked around. Already the pain was beginning to ease, and she was grateful. "Yeah...I hear you, Doc. No sling, right?"</p> <p>"No, not at this time. Just be careful how you move it around, is all. But if you reinjure it, Angel, I'll have to put one on you."</p> <p>"That's good news." Angel brightened. "At least I'll save what's left of my Inca pride."</p> <p>Elizabeth grinned. "Get outta here."</p> <p>Carefully sliding off the gurney, Angel continued cradling her bad arm against her body; it was the only position that felt comfortable right now. Pushing open the dispensary door with the toe of her black GI boot, she headed down the hall, then left the metal structure. Looking up, she saw bright shafts of sunlight flickering through the Eye, a large hole in the lava wall that protected the huge landing area and the rest of the cave. It was 1000. The day was young. And she was screwed. Glaring toward the Blackhawk helicopter, where she'd injured herself unloading supplies, she saw that all the boxes were stacked on a pallet on an electric golf cart, ready for distribution. Who was going to unpack all the medical supplies that would be dropped off? The doctor was up to her hocks in work. And Angel was useless to her now with only one good hand available.</p> <p>Frowning, she ruffled her short black hair, then pulled her soft green army cap from the back pocket of the jungle&#x2013;green&#x2013;and&#x2013;brown camouflage pants she wore. Settling the cover on her head and positioning the bill so it protected her eyes from the sudden bright light cascading into the cave, she headed for the headquarters building, which sat off to one side. She was going to talk to their commanding officer, Major Maya Stevenson.</p></p><h2>The Radium Girls</h2><p>Ordinary women in 1920s America. All they wanted was the chance to shine.

As a war raged across the world, young American women flocked to work, painting watches, clocks and military dials with a special luminous substance made from radium. It was a fun job, lucrative and glamorous - the girls themselves shone brightly in the dark, covered head to toe in the dust from the paint. They were the radium girls. As the years passed, the women began to suffer from mysterious and crippling illnesses. The very thing that had made them feel alive - their work - was in fact slowly killing them: they had been poisoned by the radium paint. Yet their employers denied all responsibility. And so, in the face of unimaginable suffering - in the face of death - these courageous women refused to accept their fate quietly, and instead became determined to fight for justice. Drawing on previously unpublished sources - including diaries, letters and court transcripts, as well as original interviews with the women&#39;s relatives - The Radium Girls is an intimate narrative account of an unforgettable true story. It is the powerful tale of a group of ordinary women from the Roaring Twenties, who themselves learned how to roar.</p><p>Kate Moore is a Sunday Times bestselling writer with more than a decade&#39;s experience in writing across varying genres, including memoir and biography and history.

In the rich, evocative prose that earned high praise for <i>Wedding Ring</i> and <i>Endless Chain,</i> Emilie Richards crafts the third tale in the Shenandoah Album series, resonant with the power of love and family ties.</p><p>Emilie Richards&#x2019;s many novels feature complex characterizations and in-depth explorations of social issues. Both are a result of her training and experience as a family counselor, which contribute to her fascination with relationships of all kinds. Emilie and her husband enjoy dividing their time between the Florida Gulf Coast and Chautauqua County, New York. She is currently working on her next novel for MIRA Books.<p>By the time the Law &amp; Order prosecutors had chosen their final strategy for another Wednesday night trial, Kendra Taylor had narrowed her own strategies to two. Either she could gracefully give up the ghost right there in front of her television set, or she could dress and drive to the drugstore to pick up the antibiotics and cough medicine her doctor had prescribed.</p> <p>The first prospect was more tempting. If Isaac ever came home from work, her husband of seven years would find her lifeless body curled into the fetal position under his heirloom Lover's Knot quilt. Imagining that scene gave her some satisfaction. And oblivion was preferable to another coughing fit.</p> <p>Unfortunately, bronchitis was rarely fatal, and she was too upset to let go. She was definitely too upset to follow the third and wisest course and let Isaac pick up her prescription first thing in the morning. Tonight Isaac had failed her, and she was in no mood for second chances. The pharmacy was open for another twenty-five minutes. Her prescriptions were sitting behind the counter. Life as she'd known it before this bout with flu was a goal to shoot for.</p> <p>Kendra tossed the quilt over the back of the sofa and sat up, face in hands until the first wave of dizziness passed. Once she was on her feet and moving, she felt steadier. In her bedroom, she stopped at the window and parted a garden of hanging ferns to gaze down at the rain-glazed street. Fractured light from street lamps and passing cars was held captive by a cold mist rising from the pavement.</p> <p>She lowered herself to the king-size bed she and Isaac shared, flattening the down comforter that looked so inviting, so soft. So incredibly warm.</p> <p>She reconsidered her options until another coughing spell sent her into cannonball position. When the spell abated, her resolve hardened. Without getting up, she managed to slide out of her nightgown and into the jeans and Washington Capitals sweatshirt she'd abandoned after her trip to the doctor.</p> <p>"Okay, world, here I come." She sounded less than enthusiastic, but at least her voice was still audible.</p> <p>On her way out of the condo, she slung her purse over her shoulder, stuffed her feet into stretched-out Ferragamo loafers and locked the door behind her. No one was in the hall, not an unusual occurrence in a building favored by childless workaholics who spent evenings bent over desks and weekends making up for sleep deficits. She and Isaac only rarely ran into their neighbors&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;a good thing, because, at the moment, she couldn't even remember names.</p> <p>The elevator didn't stop on the way to the parking garage. A District cop might have eyed the wobbly line she navigated to her parking space with interest, but she managed to start the engine of her Lexus without difficulty.</p> <p>By the time she pulled out of the garage, she was pretty sure she could make it to the drugstore and back without incident. Traffic on the Foggy Bottom streets seemed relatively sparse. Between the unseasonable cold snap that was wreaking havoc on the tidal basin's celebrated cherry blossoms, and the flu epidemic that had emptied local office buildings, most of the city's residents were already inside. Most important, George Washington University was on spring break, and the quiet streets were evidence that the students were celebrating in warmer climes.</p> <p>She knew she belonged at home. That afternoon her internist had told her to go straight to bed and stay warm, start on the antibiotics immediately and call him if her fever didn't go down in a day or so. She was this close, he insisted, to pneumonia, if not there already.</p> <p>It wasn't as if she hadn't repeated the doctor's advice to Isaac. Once she arrived home, she had managed with difficulty to track down her husband at the offices of ACRE&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;Americans Conserving and Reclaiming the Earth&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;where Isaac was managing director. When he asked why she was calling&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;not how she was feeling&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;she had repeated the doctor's advice without a noticeable edge to her voice, and explained that she had just enough strength to drop off the prescriptions and not enough to wait for them to be filled. Then she had asked him to pick them up on the way home. She wasn't sure if his parting words had included good wishes or advice, because by then, the receiver had been hovering between her ear and the cradle. She had hung up, turned over and gone to sleep.</p> <p>When she had awakened at seven, Isaac wasn't home. When she awakened at eight, their condo was still empty and she'd dragged herself to the couch to wait for him. At ten-thirty, just as the Law &amp; Order detectives turned their case over to the prosecutors, he had finally answered his cell phone, apologized curtly when she pointed out the hour, and admitted he wasn't going to be able to leave in time to get her medicine.</p> <p>He would pick it up before he left for work in the morning. That was the best he could do. She'd been on enough deadlines to understand, hadn't she?</p> <p>Now, as she pulled into the drugstore parking lot, her answer still rang in her ears. Isaac, you know what? Your best just isn't good enough anymore. I'm not sure your best is ever going to be good enough again.</p> <p>The lot was almost empty, but cars still took up all the places in front. A minivan filled with passengers was pulling out by painstaking degrees, but Kendra didn't have the patience to wait. Instead, she parked on a narrow asphalt strip on the side marked with six diagonal spaces, choosing the spot closest to the front door.</p> <p>Anger had propelled her this far, and now it propelled her into a light rain just a few degrees short of sleet. She locked the doors and shoved the keys in her pocket, then wrapped her arms around her purse, lowered her head to protect her face from the rain and hurried around the building.</p> <p>Once inside, she was hit with a wall of heat, and for a moment she struggled to catch her breath. Another coughing fit ensued, the deep racking barks that had worried her doctor. For a moment the bright lights shimmied, and she instinctively closed her eyes.</p> <p>"You okay, miss?"</p> <p>She smiled wanly at the security guard who was keeping watch and keeping warm by standing where he could see both the lot and the video monitor installed above the register.</p> <p>"Not okay, but I'll feel better once I get my prescriptions." She barked again in punctuation.</p> <p>His brow wrinkled. He was a large man, narrow shouldered and wide hipped. He was too large to be fast on his feet and too old to have superior reflexes. She wondered if it was time for the Post to do another article on rent-a-cops and whether the guards were really prepared to keep the peace.</p> <p>She managed a wobbly path toward the pharmacy at the back of the store, telling herself she was almost halfway through her excursion. In just moments she could reverse the last fifteen minutes. She pictured it. She would travel home the way she had come, slip off the loafers, the sweatshirt and jeans, and slide under the soft sage-green comforter. There was a glass of water beside the bed. She could take her medicine and close her eyes. If she was lucky, Isaac would sleep in the guest bed to avoid contamination. By morning the antibiotics might kick in.</p> <p>There was a short line at the counter. Under a flickering fluorescent light, she stood at the end and imagined easing back into bed and closing her eyes. The clerks were working at top speed, all too aware that they had to serve everyone in line before the doors were locked. Such efficiency was unusual here. She told herself she should always arrive just before closing.</p> <p>It was five to eleven before she took her place at the counter. She told the man her name and while he went to the bins to find her order, she fished for her wallet. By the time he returned, she had her credit and insurance cards ready, and he rang up the sale in record time.</p> <p>On her way out, she passed the security guard. "You feel better now," he told her as he headed for the back of the store.</p> <p>Mentally she cancelled the article and nodded her thanks.</p> <p>A sari-clad clerk unlocked the door to let her out. The moment Kendra was over the threshold, she heard the lock turn again. The rain was slushier and falling faster by the time she started back around the building.</p> <p>The anger that had brought her this far was fading, leaving a queasy feeling in her stomach.</p> <p>She was too weak to nurture anger and too sick to figure out what to do about her marriage. Isaac's preoccupation with his job was nothing new. In the past she had wondered if shared sixty-hour workweeks were the reason they were still together. If they didn't have time to talk about anything more important than the latest headline or what patch of Mother Nature ACRE had saved from development, then they could pretend that time was their only enemy. They didn't have to face the truth, that enthusiastic sex and stimulating conversation were not the only building blocks of a good marriage. That most couples shared values, hopes, dreams. That most couples had plans for their future that did not begin and end with "more of the same." That most couples in their mid-thirties had found time to discuss having children.</p> <p>She had been grappling with this for months. Unfortunately, she had been grappling alone. Isaac liked things the way they were. They had challenging jobs, a healthy income, enough time each week for a couple of dinners out to catch up on what they were doing. They took trips every summer, received coveted invitations to some of the capital's best parties and maintained enough friendships that their condo was always crowded when they gave the occasional party of their own.</p> <p>She had tried and failed to make Isaac see that they were nothing more than roommates who successfully slept together. But the idea of something more, of a relationship built on deeper emotion, a relationship in which they put each other first, seemed beyond him. In response, he had reminded her about friends who had recently divorced. This couple because of infidelity, that one because the husband spent more on cocaine than the mortgage payment. Their own problems were inconsequential. Maybe Kendra needed a new challenge at work. Maybe she would be happier if she found a subject to investigate that was worthy of another series.</p> <p>She was afraid she might be happier if she just walked away. From D.C., from the condo with its sleek leather furniture and tinted glass tables, from the husband she had vowed to love and honor until death parted them.</p> <p>She wondered how long it would take Isaac to notice.</p> <p>She didn't see the stranger crouching beside her car until she was right on top of him. The man was dressed for winter, with a knitted watch cap pulled tightly over his head and ears. His coat collar was flipped to shield the sides of his face. Between the clothing, the rain and the dim light, she couldn't see enough of him to note race, age or identifying features.</p> <p>Kendra had street smarts galore. She had pursued stories in some of the worst neighborhoods in the city and lived to tell them. Now she realized that not thinking clearly was the most compelling reason for not venturing out when ill. Fear thundered through her, and knees already weakened began to shake.</p> <p>The man stood and raised a handgun, pointing it directly at her chest. "Gimme your keys."</p> <p>The keys were in her purse. Any other night she would have taken them out in the store and had them ready. She would have approached the car cautiously and used the remote to turn on the lights. Once she was certain all was safe, she would have unlocked her door with the keyless entry system. More important, she would have parked under a light, out in the open. Or she would have waited for a spot in front.</p> <p>She remembered that the security guard had been walking toward the back of the store. Were there monitors there, as well? Please Lord, was someone inside watching?</p> <p>"I said gimme those keys, bitch!"</p> <p>"They're&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;" slowly she slid the purse strap down her arm, careful not to make sudden moves "&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;in my purse. Here. It's yours." She gathered the strap in her fist until she could hold the purse out to him, afraid if she swung it in his direction, the motion would set off a fatal chain reaction. </p> <p>He gestured with the gun. "You think I have enough hands for that?" </p></p><h2>Contemporary Marine Art: An exhibition by the American Society of Marine Artists at the Peabody Museum of Salem, May 16 thru September 15, 1981</h2><p>An exhibition by the American Society of Marine Artists at the Peabody Museum of Salem, 1981.</p><p></p><h2>Tongues of Flame</h2><p><p><b>These beautifully crafted stories depict the changing relationships between black and white southerners, the impact of the civil rights movement, and the emergence of the New South.</b></p> <p>Mary Ward Brown is a storyteller in the tradition of such powerful 20th-century writers as William Faulkner, Harper Lee, Flannery O'Connor, and Eudora Welty-writers who have explored and dramatized the tension between the inherited social structure of the South and its contemporary dissolution. With <i>Tongues of Flame,</i> her first collection of short stories, Brown bares the awkward, sometimes hopeful, and often tragic suffering of people caught in changing times within a timeless setting.</p> <p>Here we meet such memorable characters as a dying black woman who seeks the advice of a now-alcoholic white doctor whom she knew in better years; a young woman, jilted at the altar, driven crazy by an illuminated cross erected by the church opposite her house; and a 95-year-old woman buying a tombstone for her long-deceased husband only to discover that he had been adulterous throughout their marriage. Brown constructs her characters in a disarmingly plain style while breathing life into them with compassion and honesty as they confront the large moments of their lives.</p> <p>First published by E. P. Dutton in 1986 to immediate critical acclaim, <i>Tongues of Flame</i> won the 1987 PEN/Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award. The judges commended Brown for "seeing life whole, without prejudice, without sentimentality, without histrionics. Her voice may be quiet-sometimes she speaks in a whisper-but her words are, nevertheless, always forceful, clear, and ultimately lasting." With this new publication of Tongues of Flame and its inclusion in the University of Alabama Press's Deep South Books series, a whole new generation of readers may once more discover Mary Ward Brown's profound stories of pain, loss, and hope.</p></p><p>Stories of the Deep South from a woman&#39;s point of view, depicting the changing relationships between black and white people, the impact of the civil rights movement, and the emergence of the New South.<p><b>Mary Ward Brown</b> is an award-winning writer who lives in her family home in Browns, Alabama</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Iktomi Loses His Eyes</h2><p>Iktomi the trikster finds himself in a predicament after losing his eyes when he misuses a magical trick.</p><p>Grade 2-5 The infamous Lakota trickster is once again on the losing end of a trick. Iktomi watches as a man commands his eyes to leave his head and then calls them back. The mysterious stranger tells Iktomi the secret of his trick but warns him never to do it more than four times in one day. Naturally, Iktomi must show off his new skill to his friends and does so once too often. When he finds that he can't retrieve his eyes, he stumbles about until he convinces Buffalo and Mouse to each give him one eye. Unfortunately, these replacements don't provide the vision and perspective needed to maneuver in the human world. As in Goble's previous titles about this legendary rascal, this book operates on many levels. It is an amusing trickster tale as well as a symbolic story about limited perception and understanding. Historical elements about Plains Indian life are juxtaposed with contemporary objects and attitudes. Varied typography delineates the story's narration from Iktomi's thoughts and ongoing comments meant to elicit responses from listeners. Different fonts and crisp, colorful artwork create an attractive book. Fans of Goble's unique narrative and visual style won't be disappointed with the latest account of Iktomi's outlandish antics. Heide Piehler, Shorewood Public Library, WI <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Multilayered and virtually multimedia, Goble's latest again presents a sly, very funny trickster tale with gorgeous illustrations. An obviously Bad Guy, with a black hat and a bottle of whiskey, gets the preening Iktomi to sign a land sale deed by teaching him how to throw his eyes from his head--and get them back--telling him that he can do this only four times a day. Iktomi immediately breaks that rule and finds himself eyeless. He tricks an eye each from Mouse and Buffalo, but their different sizes don't work well together. Goble does great things with the picture space: Iktomi, in full Plains regalia, resembles an image on a blanket or an anthropological watercolor. Other figures appear as small totems or as silhouettes. Goble plays with the text, too: Iktomi addresses the audience in small fonts (or handwritten scrawls) scattered across the pictures; the narrator's commentary (separate from the story) is in gray type. Goble lists his detailed sources and offers an introduction, but he also lets Iktomi have his say: "This is more lies about me by that white guy, Paul Goble." Goble enters the spirit of the trickster tale fully, making the book and its telling as tricky as Iktomi (whose name means spider). <i>GraceAnne A.

Even those very familiar with the Ramayana will enjoy this version, where the hero is Phra Ram and the heroine Nang [Lady] Seeda and the Demon King of Lanka, Totsagan. The Thai version is a much rowdier version than the Indian, perhaps reflecting the Thais more casual attitudes towards the weaknesses of humans (and gods) and their pleasure in life and its enjoyment (sanuk). In this version, Hanuman dallies with a number of lovely maidens, even fathering a son by one who eventually will play a small role in helping Hanuman in the 14-year epoch wars that re-unite Ram and Seeda.</p><p></p><h2>Cezanne in Provence</h2><p>Over-sized soft cover book (350 pages) titled CEZANNE IN PROVENCE.

In fact, most days, if you peeked inside the window, you would see only one orphan, all by herself but hardly lonely, standing on her tiptoes at the kitchen counter, baking a cake.<br>Cadence, that was her name.<br><br>She was standing there now, Cady, deciding what to add to her bowl of batter. If you squinted through the window, you could just make her out from the chin up (Cady was barely a wisp of a thing). You&#x2019;d see the shiny, crow-black hair that hung smooth as paper from the top of her head to the bottoms of her earlobes. And you&#x2019;d see the petite&#x2014;pixieish, Miss Mallory called them&#x2014;features of her face. Tiny nose, tiny mouth, tiny ears. Cady&#x2019;s eyes, however, those were large in comparison to the rest of her. Large and dark and round, and set just so on a face the color of a leaf that has clung too long to its tree.<br><br>Flour, sugar, butter, eggs. Cady studied the bowl in front of her. She closed her eyes, digging into the furthest reaches of her brain to figure out what would be the perfect addition to her cake. At last her thick black lashes fluttered open. She had it.<br><br>Cinnamon. She would make a cinnamon cake.<br><br>No one knew exactly when Cady&#x2019;s Talent for baking had first emerged&#x2014;just as no one knew exactly where she had come from. But one thing was certain: Cady was a Talented baker. She could bake anything, really. Pies. Muffins. Bread. Casseroles. Even the perfect pizza if she put her mind to it. But what Cady loved above all else was baking cakes. All she needed to do was to close her eyes, and she could imagine the absolutely perfect cake for any person, anywhere. A pinch more salt, a touch less cream. It was one hundred percent certain that the person she was baking for would never have tasted anything quite so heavenly in all his life. In fact, what the orphanage lacked in orphans it made up for in cake-baking trophies. Five first-place trophies from the Sunshine Bakers of America Annual Cake Bakeoff lined the front hall, one for every year that Cady had entered from the age of five, when her oven mitts swallowed her up to?the elbows. No matter who entered the competition&#x2014;�professional bakers, famous chefs with exclusive restaurants&#x2014;none of their Talents were able to match Cady&#x2019;s, not for five years running. Cady&#x2019;s cakes were never the most beautiful, or the most stunning. Last year not one but two bakers had crafted fifty-layer-high masterpieces of sugary wonder, studded with frosted stars and flowers and figurines. One even included a working chocolate fountain. Cady&#x2019;s single-layer pistachio sheet cake had looked pitiful in comparison. But nonetheless, it had been the judge&#x2019;s favorite, because Cady had baked it specifically for him.<br><br>This year&#x2019;s bakeoff would be held in just one short week in New York City, a two-hour drive away. Miss Mallory had already cleared space in the hallway for a sixth trophy.<br>The kitchen door squeaked open and in waltzed Miss Mallory,� a polka-dot tablecloth folded in her arms. (Miss Mallory&#x2019;s� perfect cake, as far as Cady was concerned, was just as scrumptious as she was&#x2014;a nutty peach cake with cream cheese frosting.)<br><br>&#x201c;What did you come up with?&#x201d; Miss Mallory asked, crossing the room to peer into the cake bowl.<br><br>Cady found the cinnamon in the cabinet above her and popped off the lid. &#x201c;Cinnamon,&#x201d; she replied, shaking the spice into the bowl. Cady had no need for measurements. &#x201c;A cinnamon cake, three layers high.&#x201d;<br><br>Miss Mallory took a deep breath of pleasure. &#x201c;And the frosting?&#x201d;<br><br>Cady did not even need a moment to think. She knew the answer, sensed it the way other people could sense which way to walk home after a stroll in the woods. &#x201c;Chocolate buttercream with a hint of spice,&#x201d; she replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; Miss Mallory said. &#x201c;Amy will love it.&#x201d; She snuck a finger out from under her tablecloth to poke a tiny glob from the bowl. &#x201c;I hope this fog finally gives up,&#x201d; she said, sighing as the taste of the batter hit her tongue.<br><br>Cady had been so intent on her baking that she hadn&#x2019;t even noticed the haze. She peered out the window. Out on the lawn, the thick mist obscured all but the legs of the picnic table, and puddles speckled the steps to the porch.<br><br>It had been foggy the morning Cady was brought to Miss Mallory&#x2019;s, too. Cady had been much too young to remember it, but she&#x2019;d heard the story so many times that the details were as real and comfortable as a pair of well-worn shoes. The damp smell of the dew outside. The mystery novel Miss Mallory had been reading when she heard the knock at the door. And most especially, Miss Mallory&#x2019;s surprise at the arrival.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d never seen a baby so small,&#x201d; Miss Mallory always told her. &#x201c;And with such a remarkable head of hair. There was a braid woven into it.&#x201d; Here Miss Mallory would trace the plaits across Cady&#x2019;s scalp, making Cady&#x2019;s skin tingle delightfully. &#x201c;It was the most intricate braid I&#x2019;ve ever seen, twisted in and about and around itself like a crown. Whoever gave you that braid was Talented indeed.&#x201d;<br><br>Miss Mallory snuck one more fingerful of batter from the bowl. &#x201c;Perhaps we should move the party inside today,&#x201d; she suggested.<br><br>&#x201c;But Adoption Day parties are always outside,&#x201d; Cady protested, slapping Miss Mallory&#x2019;s hand away playfully. There wasn&#x2019;t much consistency in the life of an orphan&#x2014;new housemates coming and going like waves on a shore&#x2014;but Adoption Day parties were always the same. Adoption Day parties took place outside, with presents and card games (it was difficult to play other sorts of games with so few people about) and a cake baked by Cady for the lucky little girl whose Adoption Day it was.<br><br>People sometimes suspected, when they learned how few orphans lived at Miss Mallory&#x2019;s Home for Lost Girls, that it must be a sorry excuse for an orphanage. But the truth was quite the opposite. The truth was that most of the orphans at Miss Mallory&#x2019;s found their perfect families astonishingly quickly. Miss Mallory had a Talent for matching orphans to families&#x2014;she felt a tug, deep in her chest, she said, when she sensed that two people truly belonged together, and she just knew. Most of the little girls who came through the orphanage doors were matched within days of arriving, sometimes hours. Miss Mallory had famously matched one girl only seven minutes after she stepped off her train. They would send photos, those lucky little girls who had found their perfect families, and Miss Mallory would frame them and hang them in the front hallway, just above Cady&#x2019;s row of trophies. Smiling kids, beaming parents.<br><br>Cady had studied them carefully.<br><br>Cady was the only orphan at Miss Mallory&#x2019;s who had ever stayed for an extended period of time. Oh, Miss Mallory had tried to match her. Over the years Cady had been sent to live?with no fewer than six families&#x2014;loving, happy, wonderful families&#x2014;but unlike with the other orphans, it had never quite worked out. Cady had always done her best to be the perfect daughter. She yes, ma&#x2019;amed and no, sired and ate all her vegetables and went to bed on time. But no fewer than six times, Miss Mallory had come to return Cady to the orphanage long before her one-week trial period was over. &#x201c;I made a mistake,&#x201d; Miss Mallory always told her. &#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t your perfect family.&#x201d;<br>But Cady knew that Miss Mallory didn&#x2019;t make mistakes. Somehow, for some reason that Cady couldn&#x2019;t explain, the fault lay with her. And Cady vowed that if she ever got another chance, with another family, she would do whatever it took to make it work. One day she would have an Adoption Day party of her own. One day she would bake the perfect cake for herself.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Cady said slowly, glancing outside at the beautifully foggy morning, &#x201c;maybe today&#x2019;s the day I&#x2019;ll meet my family.&#x201d; The very idea warmed her through just as much as the heat from the oven. She tugged an oven mitt onto each hand and opened the oven door, then set the cake pans on the center rack. &#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; she said again, &#x201c;my real and true family will step right out of the fog.&#x201d;</p><h2>The War Against Women</h2><p>"Terrifying...Impressive...A challenging esay that justifies the feminist revival."<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES<br>Bestselling author and feminist scholar Marilyn French has written a shocking and fascinating analysis of the history of women's political, cultural, physical, and economic repression that is as controversial as it is utterly convincing. In this stunning work of resarch, Ms. French creates a devastating portrait of today's male-dominated global society, with its underlying aim of destroying, subjugating, or mutilating women.

If spoken in another context, it meant grace, though there was little of that to be had in the city that summer. Not now&#x2014;�now that the new invention had been permanently installed in La Place de la R�volution. Crosses had been torn from the altars of churches, cross-�shaped pendants ripped from women&#x2019;s breasts and tossed into the filthy gutters that emptied red into the Seine. In many public places, the image of the cross was replaced by the nation&#x2019;s new holy icon: the guillotine.<br><br>On the Left Bank, in a narrow street of sunbaked houses, every window was ajar, so that any resident could tell you with some precision about the comings and goings of each occupant in the adjacent flat or home. On this morning, the couple living on the east corner, above the tavern, was quarreling&#x2014;�fighting over money, or the heat, or the stale bread that was supposed to have lasted for days. The couple across from them, based on the sounds issuing from their bedchamber, had made up from last night&#x2019;s quarrel. And a dog on the street, its ribs jutting out from under its tawny coat, had found a prize stew bone, which it had dragged out of the tavern and onto the street, where it now sat gnawing, hoping to coax every last bit of marrow from within.<br><br>&#x201c;Why, you mangy beast, that&#x2019;s where it&#x2019;s got to!&#x201d; Madame Grocque, the wife of the tavern keeper, lurched out of her door and swiped at the dog with her broom. Seizing on the mutt&#x2019;s momentary shock, she stooped down and snatched the bone with her thick, dirty fingers. The dog, recovered from its beating, jumped at the woman, fixing his teeth on the treat she would deny him.<br><br>&#x201c;You worthless creature, I&#x2019;ll skin you and throw you in the stew alongside this bone! It&#x2019;d do us good to get a bit o&#x2019; fresh meat.&#x201d; Madame Grocque kicked at the animal, but the mutt refused to release the first morsel it had scrounged in days.<br><br>From a window on the top floor of this dwelling, a young man, not quite thirty years of age, dropped his quill and listened to the raucous activity below. Rubbing his eyes, he sighed. &#x201c;Soon. Someday soon we&#x2019;ll get out of this neighborhood.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jean-�Luc?&#x201d; his wife called from the other side of the door, her voice mixing with the familiar morning sounds of clanging dishes and the crying baby. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t you have any breakfast before you leave?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Coming, Marie.&#x201d; The lawyer pushed himself away from the desk in the corner of the bedroom. Standing, he rolled up his papers and loaded them into his satchel. He crossed the small room in two strides, reaching for the vest and threadbare jacket that she had set out for him. When he had dressed in his plain gray suit, he checked his reflection in the filmy glass of the cracked mirror. Was that a gray hair he spotted? He leaned in closer, sighing. After the year he&#x2019;d had, he wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if there were quite a few gray hairs streaking his dark ponytail. His hazel eyes now stared back at him from within a thin web of unfamiliar lines, a new one seeming to appear each week.<br><br>In the other room, the chamber that served as kitchen, dining room, and living room all in one, Marie stood with the baby balanced on her hip. She smiled when she spotted Jean-�Luc in the door. &#x201c;Will you take some coffee?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d; He leaned in and kissed them both, first his wife and then his son.<br><br>Marie leaned her head to the side, lifting the pot with her free hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, right. Coffee, yes. Please.&#x201d; Jean-�Luc sat at the table before a plate of black bread, the remnants of yesterday&#x2019;s loaf, and a square of hard cheese. Marie served him watered-�down coffee as he cleared the papers that he had left strewn across the table. She had every window open, but the air in their top-�floor flat hung stale and oppressive from the months of thick heat.<br><br>&#x201c;You were tossing and turning all night.&#x201d; Marie shifted the baby and sat down across from her husband at the small table. &#x201c;Trouble sleeping again?&#x201d;<br><br>He swallowed a piece of the hard bread, nodding. Outside, the old Grocque woman still hollered at the dog, the beast yelping in response to another swipe of her broom. Marie looked from her husband to the open window and rose to close it.<br><br>&#x201c;No, leave it open.&#x201d; He reached for her hand and kept her at the table.<br><br>&#x201c;Next time you decide to work in the middle of the night, you might try moving out here to&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. I should come out here so that I don&#x2019;t wake you and Mathieu. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; He sipped the thin coffee as she sat back down. &#x201c;Will you forgive me for imposing my accursed sleeplessness on you?&#x201d;<br><br>She narrowed her eyes and reached for a piece of his cheese, which she broke off between her fingertips and began to nibble. &#x201c;I suppose. But it&#x2019;s getting worse, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is?&#x201d;<br><br>She leaned her head to the side. &#x201c;Your accursed sleeplessness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he replied. They sat opposite each other in silence, he eating his breakfast, she nursing the baby. After several minutes, he propped his elbows on the table and cleared his throat. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to take the Widow Poitier&#x2019;s case.&#x201d;<br><br>Stroking the baby&#x2019;s cheek, Marie lowered her eyes, and Jean-�Luc waited for her reaction. After a pause, she said: &#x201c;She can&#x2019;t pay, can she?&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head, no. <br><br>She looked up at him, her brown eyes serious. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good man, Jean-�Luc St. Clair.&#x201d;<br><br>He took his coffee in his hands, concealing his grin. Her approval, these days so difficult to get, always elicited that grin from him. He looked at her now, her arms full with his baby, her eyes holding his own steadily. &#x201c;So then, my beloved wife, you&#x2019;ve forgiven me for removing you from your beloved south and bringing you to languish in this cramped garret?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Forgiven you?&#x201d; Her lovely eyes widened, her lashes fluttering a few times, reminding him of the girl who had bewitched him. How glorious she was, still. &#x201c;Who said anything about forgiving you?&#x201d; She offered half a grin, and he couldn&#x2019;t resist the urge to lean forward and kiss her.<br><br>He had moved her from the south of France just over a year ago, only a few months after they had been married. Her father had a steady, if not excessively lucrative, legal practice just outside of Marseille, not far from the village where Jean-�Luc&#x2019;s family had owned a small plot of land since the time of the Sun King, Louis XIV.<br><br>The St. Clair family had sustained the comfortable farmhouse on the small but fertile plot for centuries. It wasn&#x2019;t until his father&#x2019;s assumption of the property that the fortunes of the family&#x2014;�and indeed of the region, and all of France&#x2014;�had deteriorated so drastically. They had been forced to sell off most of the property, keeping only a half acre with one milk cow, a handful of chickens, and the house for the widower and his son, Jean-�Luc. It wasn&#x2019;t from a lack of industriousness that Jean-�Luc&#x2019;s father had lost the family land; old Claude St. Clair had been a faithful steward of his family&#x2019;s assets. He was simply another victim of the droughts and crippling financial circumstances that had plagued the rest of the country under the latest Bourbon king, the heir of the Sun King&#x2019;s heir, the most reviled man in France: Louis XVI. Yet, His Majesty could not be considered the most reviled monarch in France; that moniker went to his Austrian-�born wife, Marie-�Antoinette.<br><br>When it had come time for Jean-�Luc to plan his own future, he&#x2019;d taken his father&#x2019;s advice and had applied himself to the study of law. What else was there for him? The land was gone; there was no longer wealth to be had in farming, unless you were a nobleman who skimmed the profits from the peasants and then paid no taxes on that bounty. His mother had died in his early boyhood; his only sibling, a sister five years older, had married at the age of sixteen and had been living an ocean away in the New World colony of Saint-�Domingue. Other than the handful of letters he&#x2019;d received from her over the years, Jean-�Luc St. Clair, prior to beginning his legal studies in �Marseille, had been occupied chiefly by attending to his elderly father.<br><br>Jean-�Luc had enjoyed his time at school, which offered more excitement and opportunity than he could find in his lonely, quiet home. Having excelled in his studies at Aix-�Marseille University, the ambitious young lawyer sought something greater than the small hometown magistrate&#x2019;s office. He applied for a position as a low-�level attorney at a reputable law practice closer to Marseille. Meeting and falling in love with Marie Germaine, his employer&#x2019;s pretty daughter with thick brunette curls and quick, pert opinions, had been an unexpected but happy windfall.<br><br>Jean-�Luc had been employed in his new office, his bride happily installed in their comfortable cottage on her father&#x2019;s estate, when the news reached Marseille that King Louis and Queen Marie-�Antoinette had been plucked from their gilded palace at Versailles and moved back to Paris, where they&#x2019;d been forced to live among their people. Jean-�Luc, a budding idealist whose family&#x2019;s hopes had been nearly extinguished under an inept monarch, and who had followed with great interest the crafting of a nascent republic in the American colonies, had longed to ride to Paris like so many of his young fellow countrymen. He did not hide his desire to join the people and sacrifice his worldly comforts and, if necessary, his life, in the name of liberty. Would it not be shameful, he asked Marie, to be born in this era of history and yet shrink from the glorious undertaking of a free people rising up in the name of liberty, equality, and fraternity?<br><br>Mathieu arrived six months after their relocation to Paris, and Jean-�Luc had been grateful of it. Marie was less lonely with the dark-�haired little boy, who shared her coffee-�colored eyes and spirited personality, to fill the long hours while Jean-�Luc worked as a low-�level administrative attorney for the new government. They had settled in this two-�room garret&#x2014;�drafty in the winter, stifling in the summer&#x2014;�as it was all that his modest government salary could afford. His father-�in-�law, furious at Jean-�Luc for taking his daughter so far north, had refused to support the move. If he could only see how she was living now, Jean-�Luc thought, looking around at their cramped quarters. They, being from the south, had never known the bitterness of a northern winter until this past year. Nor had either of them ever passed a summer without the salty sea breezes and shade of the fragrant citrus trees. It had been a trying year for both of them.<br><br>But Marie, bless her, never complained; she never held it against Jean-�Luc that he had removed her from her father&#x2019;s comfortable home to this loud, dirty city. A place where, on more than one occasion, they&#x2019;d had to choose between food and fuel. She was tough, yes. But that was also because she was, Jean-�Luc suspected, as much of an idealist as he was, even if she would never have dared admit it.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Bigwig, you are, with your own carriage this morning.&#x201d; Marie had risen from the table and was looking out the small window, Mathieu fussing as she tried to burp him.<br><br>Jean-�Luc took a last bite of rough bread and drained his coffee. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Gavreau. He plans to send me out on one of his cases. Knows I won&#x2019;t mind as long as I&#x2019;ve got the carriage.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the case?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Another mansion. This one belonging to a nobleman who lives . . . well, used to live, in Place Royale.&#x201d; Jean-�Luc collected the remaining papers strewn across the table and stuffed them into his packed portefeuille. &#x201c;The Jacobins want to use the house.&#x201d;<br><br>Marie nodded, arching an eyebrow. &#x201c;So they&#x2019;ve sent the carriage for you.&#x201d; He was privileged to have the job he had, even if the salary was insufficient. More than half of Paris was starving, and he rode a carriage to work some days.<br><br>His work dealt in cataloging property as it was seized from the wealthy families, former treasure of the ancien r�gime, now as obsolete as the old order itself. Daily inventory of seized goods&#x2014;perhaps it was not as stimulating or significant as the work he had hoped to find; perhaps he was not playing a tremendously important role in building the new France&#x2014;at least not yet. But before they could build the new country, someone had to figure out the proper way of dismantling the former one. For now, that was his work, to manage the spoils until the state had decided what to do with them. As for the former proprietors whose treasures he now catalogued, Jean-�Luc rarely heard mention of them, and perhaps he did not want to.<br><br>&#x201c;What happened to the family?&#x201d; Marie, as usual, had reached directly into his mind and plucked out his thoughts with her uncanny insight. She held his gaze with her earnest brown eyes as the baby began to cry on her hip.<br><br>&#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d; Jean-�Luc tugged on the hem of his jacket.<br><br>&#x201c;You said you&#x2019;re going out to a nobleman&#x2019;s house in Place Royale to collect the family&#x2019;s goods. What happened to the family?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d; He shifted his weight, looking back down toward the papers. &#x201c;They are already gone, from the sound of it. Prison?&#x201d; Fortunately, he usually visited the grand houses after the occupants had been dragged from their chambers and thrown in the dungeons at the Conciergerie, La Force, or Les Carmes. He&#x2019;d heard the rumors&#x2014;�reports from colleagues who had visited the prisons. He suspected that if he were to witness the conditions for himself, his current troubles sleeping would grow much worse. Best not to dwell on such negative thoughts, he reminded himself. Best to remember the noble work they were doing, bringing liberty, equality, and fraternity to a people long subjugated by inept Bourbon despots and their callous aristocrats.<br><br>Sighing, he looped his portefeuille under his arm and crossed the room toward his wife. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We could always go . . . back . . . you know.&#x201d; Marie avoided her husband&#x2019;s gaze now, bouncing the baby in an attempt to calm him. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s getting to be too much. If it&#x2019;s not what you thought it would be.&#x201d;</p><h2>I Can Do It by Myself (Golden Sturdy Book)</h2><p>A child demonstrates the things she can do by herself all day long. On board pages.</p><p></p><h2>The Sissy Duckling</h2><p>Elmer is not like the other boy ducklings. While they like to build forts, he loves to bake cakes. While they like to play baseball, he wants to put on the halftime show. Elmer is a great big sissy. <br> But when his father is wounded by a hunter's shot, Elmer proves that the biggest sissy can also be the greatest hero. <br> Acclaimed actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein has crafted a heartwarming story, based on his award-winning HBO animated special, about learning to embrace the special qualities we all possess. Henry Cole's gently humorous illustrations give it a new vitality. This is a book to share with all children, to help them understand that each one of them is unique and valuable.</p><p>Harvey Fierstein is a four-time Tony Award-winning writer, actor, and gay-rights activist. In 1983, he received two Tonys for writing and starring in <i>Torch Song Trilogy</i>, received a third Tony the following year for writing <i>La Cage aux Folle, </i>and another in 2003 for Best Actor in<i> Hairspray</i>. Film audiences know him best for his scene-stealing antics in <i>Mrs. Doubtfire</i> and <i>Independence Day</i>, and he lent his trademark gravelly voice to Disney&#x2019;s <i>Mulan</i> as Mulan&#x2019;s soldier friend. He has made numerous TV appearances, including an Emmy-nominated appearance on <i>Cheers</i> and on a classic episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> as Homer&#x2019;s assistant, Karl. Children know him as the Easter Bunny from the Emmy-winning <i>Elmo Saves Christmas</i>. Harvey also wrote the book for the play <i>Kinky Boots</i>, which won the 2013 Tony for Best Musical.<br><br>Henry Cole has written and illustrated more than fifty books for children, including<i>&nbsp;Spot, the Cat</i>;&nbsp;<i>And Tango Makes Three</i>;&nbsp;<i>Oink?</i>;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Little Bo in France</i>. He is also the illustrator of <i>With a Little Help from My Friends </i>by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. A former elementary school teacher, he now writes and paints full time.Elmer is the happiest duckling in the whole forest, doing all the things he loves best: painting pictures, decorating cookies, sometimes even playing with the girls. But when Papa Duck insists he learn baseball like all the other boy ducks, Elmer fails miserably and, alas, is branded <i>sissy</i> (yes, a scarcely veiled term for homosexual). From that point on, there's no peace for the poor guy. Big bully Drake Duckling makes his life miserable at school, and although at home his mother assures him he's "special," and that he will amaze everyone, his Neanderthal father rejects him, angrily declaring, "He's no son of mine." Devastated, Elmer runs away to make a solitary new home for himself in the forest. He's admirably self-sufficient in the domestic department, but he's lonely and aches to see his parents once more. When hunting season comes, an accident delivers a surprising opportunity for Elmer to get his wish, and also to demonstrate to his father and to everyone else how very special and, indeed, amazing he really is.<p>Based on playwright-actor Fierstein's animated HBO special of the same name, this picture book is something of a landmark title. Although it's not the first gay-themed book for youngsters, it's arguably the first one from a major trade publisher. The slender selection of previous efforts on this subject have, for the most part, come from smaller or specialty houses, most notably Alyson Publications, which has given us Michael Willhoite's <i>Daddy's Room</i> mate (1991) and Leslea Newman's <i>Heather Has Two Mommies</i> (1991). There have also been a handful of picture books dealing with AIDS--e.g., Newman's <i>Too Far Away to Touch</i> (Clarion, 1995) and Mary Kate Jordan's <i>Losing Uncle Tim</i> (Whitman, 1989)--and at least one about the subject of gay uncles, Judith Vigna's 1995 <i>My Two Uncles</i>, also published by Whitman. The point is that these books have seldom received wide distribution, and even more important, the gay characters in them are all adults. The one notable exception to this, a book that <i>The Sissy Duckling</i> marginally resembles, is Tomie de Paola's <i>Oliver Button Is a Sissy</i> (Harcourt, 1979). This semiautobiographical book is also the story of a boy who doesn't like to do "things boys are supposed to do." The difference is that <i>Oliver Button--</i> like Charlotte Zolotow's pioneering <i>William's Baby</i> (Harper, 1972)--is more focused on the issue of gender stereotyping than on homosexuality. </p><p>Fierstein's book is much more in-your-face about this duckling's differences. As Elmer eventually declares, "I am a BIG SISSY and PROUD of it!" And the story concludes with a declaration that "out in the world Elmer met lots of other ducks just like himself."</p><p> Elmer's gay identity is even more evident in the artwork. There's lots of pink in Henry Cole's wonderfully droll, personality-packed, cartoon illustrations: Elmer wears a pink bathing cap and sports snazzy, heart-shaped sunglasses at the beach; he carries his books in a flowered pink backpack; he dances around his new forest home wearing a pink apron and carrying a feather duster; and he decorates cookies with pink frosting. Perhaps most telling, though, is the picture of Ethel Merman hanging on his bedroom wall. All of this, including the glitter used on the jacket's book title (also in pink), is saved from any hint of didacticism by the obvious affection and good humor with which it's done, so children can enjoy the story on different levels. The story, moreover, is fueled by drama and character, and Elmer is such a lovable, sweet-spirited duck that readers of all ages can't help but chorus, "Hey, Elmer! You go, duckling!" <i>Michael Cart</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Here, Diarmaid Ferriter investigates the far more complex personal and public identities of the revolutionary fighter, Fianna F�il party founder, taoiseach (prime minister) and president who reimagined the state both literally, in its first constitution, and figuratively, offering a much mocked vision of Ireland as a pre-industrial, pastoral island. Ferriter presents an in-depth analysis of De Valera using previously unpublished letters, government documents and photographs to chronicle his long and remarkable career. One such letter contradicts the conventional wisdom that de Valera escaped execution in 1916 because of his American citizenship, offering the leader&#x2019;s personal account of events. Engagingly written and tactile to hold, <i>Judging Dev</i> won four prestigious Irish book awards and awakened a national conversation through a parallel RTE radio series and RIA exhibition. When an Irish taoiseach launched this book in 2007 it was fittingly said it would be &#x2018;equally invaluable in classroom, in college and in the home&#x2019;.</p><p>Diarmaid Ferriter is a Professor of Modern Irish History at the School of History, University College Dublin. His main research interest is the social, political and cultural history of twentieth century Ireland. His book Judging Dev: A Reassessment of the Life and Legacy of Eamon De Valera was published by the Royal Irish Academy in 2007. He also contributed a chapter, &#x2018;&#x2018;A figurative scramble for the bones of the patriot dead&#x2019;: Commemorating the Rising, 1922-65&#x2019;, to the publication 1916 in 1966: Commemorating the Easter Rising (2007).&#34;The Sunday Business Post 14/10/2007 Reviewed by Emmanuel Kehoe &#34;Ferriter&#39;s thoughtful and timely new work is unique in that it reproduces in wonderful detail large numbers of original documents...sight of original documents is usually denied to the hobby historian and the quality of the reproduction, complete with all the originals, errors and corrections, is so good one can almost feel the bite of the typewriter on the paper and smell the dried ink.&#34; The Sunday Tribune 14/10/2007 Reviewed by Kevin Rafter &#34;Judging Dev is a resounding success for both the author and his publisher, the Royal Irish Academy. The book is wonderfully produced with its text inter-spread by photographs and illustrations, many of which will be new to even the strongest readers of Irish history.&#34; The Sunday Independent 21/10/2007 Reviewed by John A Murphy &#34;The book&#39;s great and original source is the deValera archive in UCD, which was not freely available to earlier scholars. Is supplies the marvellously illustrated material at the heart of this publication - longhand and typewritten letters and documents which give a striking sense of historical immediacy, and beautifully reproduced photographs never seen before, freshly touching on every phase of Dev&#39;s career and concisely contexted by the author. All this stuff alone is worth much more than the (very reasonable) publication price of Euro 30. The photos and documents take up approximately 250 out of the book&#39;s 370 pages so that the text is relatively brief. It is a sustained analytical essay on de Valera&#39;s career, richly drawling from the UCD archive but also taking into account the judgements of past and present de Valera scholars and commentators. Overall Ferriter&#39;s assessments are superbly fresh, independent and sophisticated.&#34;</p><h2>NIV, The Way for Cowboys New Testament, Paperback</h2><p><p>Anybody who loves the cowboy lifestyle will identify with <em>NIV The Way for Cowboys, New Testament</em>.

This second edition includes a new appendix of sample scansions, and a comprehensive index of poets and poems cited.<br> <br>"This intelligent, user-friendly book is a quality guide to rhyme, rhythm, meter, and form for students, experienced readers, and practitioners of poetry... <i>The Poem's Heartbeat</i> may well be the finest general book available on prosody."-<i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)<br> <br>"In lucid prose, Corn clears a straight path through the scansion of quantitative verse and free verse... A provocative, definitive manual on meter."<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br> <br>"A lively and well-informed primer to prosody, a current hot topic in poetic studies. Corn's aim is to introduce the novice poet or student to the vocabulary and understanding of English prosody, from its basic rules and definitions to the complexities of how sound is measured in poetry. Recommended for all academic libraries, this book could only have been written by someone who cares about the details, the relation of sound to sense, and fine, clear expression."-<i>Choice</i><br> <br>"The Poem's Heartbeat triumphs over the dryness-or supposed dryness-of the subject, treating every aspect of it with precision, dispatch, and apt illustration. That it is sorely needed in the present footless state of things goes without saying."-Richard Wilbur</p><p>Alfred Corn is a poet, novelist, and art critic. His poems appear regularly in The New Yorker, The Nation, and the New Republic. He has traveled widely and taught at many universities, including Columbia, UCLA, and Yale. He lives in New York.This book shatters stereotypes equating the study of prosody with poetry boot camp and instead introduces the fine art of versification. In clear bell tones that are this master poet's rhythmic signature, nuances of rhyme, rhythm, and meter are conveyed in precise, tactile language sensitive to history and etymology. Usually dry definitions are transformed into subtle image schemes that work as superior mnemonic devices. We learn, for example, that "line" comes from the Latin linea, which is derived from the word for a thread of linen. Corn compares the composition of lines to weaving a thread slowly from left to right. In the hands of the skilled poet, a line's repeated "quick left reversal" at the text's margin can hypnotize, or summon the unconscious part of the mind. Metrical variations, usually muddled through by most texts, here receive their own lucid chapter that thoroughly prepares the poet for progressively more complex sections. By the book's end, Corn, magi-teacher and impeccable guide, has taught the novice to become artist and magician, wielding stress and syllable to spark "intuitive and technical lightning-flashes" and a "depth charge of insight" that leave the dreary formal footsteps of tradition far behind. <br><i>Copyright � 1996, Boston Review.

It chronicles the life of Booker T. Washington from his birth as a slave to his eventual triumph against the odds as he became one of America&#39;s leading educators and reformers. One can not but feel for him as he describes the horrors of his early life with complete honesty. This truly motivational book is an all-time classic!</p><p>Nineteenth-century African American businessman, activist, and educator Booker Taliaferro Washington's <i>Up from Slavery</i> is one of the greatest American autobiographies ever written. Its mantras of black economic empowerment, land ownership, and self-help inspired generations of black leaders, including Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and Louis Farrakhan. In rags-to-riches fashion, Washington recounts his ascendance from early life as a mulatto slave in Virginia to a 34-year term as president of the influential, agriculturally based Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. From that position, Washington reigned as the most important leader of his people, with slogans like "cast down your buckets," which emphasized vocational merit rather than the academic and political excellence championed by his contemporary rival W.E.B. Du Bois. Though many considered him too accommodating to segregationists, Washington, as he said in his historic "Atlanta Compromise" speech of 1895, believed that "political agitation alone would not save [the Negro]," and that "property, industry, skill, intelligence, and character" would prove necessary to black Americans' success. The potency of his philosophies are alive today in the nationalist and conservative camps that compose the complex quilt of black American society.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

He lives in Madrid.<i>Excerpted from the hardcover edition.<br></i>1<br><br>Between March or April 2000 and August 2008, while I was traveling and writing articles and living in Germany, my consumption of certain drugs made me almost completely lose my memory, so that what I remember of those eight years&#x2014;�at least what I remember of some ninety-�five months of those eight years&#x2014;�is pretty vague and sketchy: I remember the rooms of two houses I lived in, I remember snow getting in my shoes as I struggled to make my way to the street from the door of one of those houses, I remember that later I spread salt and the snow turned brown and started to dissolve, I remember the door to the office of the psychiatrist who treated me but I don&#x2019;t remember his name or how I found him. He was balding and weighed me on every visit; I guess it was once a month or something like that. He asked me how things were going, and then he weighed me and gave me more pills. A few years after leaving that German city, I returned and retraced the path to that psychiatrist&#x2019;s office and I read his name on the plaque alongside the other doorbells, but it was just a name, nothing that explained why I&#x2019;d visited him or why he&#x2019;d weighed me each time, or how I could have let my memory go down the drain like that; at the time, I told myself I could knock on his door and ask him why I&#x2019;d been his patient and what had happened to me during those years, but then I thought I should have made an appointment, that the psychiatrist wouldn&#x2019;t remember me anyway, and, besides, I&#x2019;m not really all that curious about myself. Maybe one day a child of mine will want to know who his father was and what he did during those eight years in Germany and he&#x2019;ll go to the city and walk through it, and, perhaps, with his father&#x2019;s directions, he&#x2019;ll show up at the psychiatrist&#x2019;s office and find out everything. I suppose at some point all children need to know who their parents were and they take it upon themselves to find out. Children are detectives of their parents, who cast them out into the world so that one day the children will return and tell them their story so that they themselves can understand it. These children aren&#x2019;t judging their parents&#x2014;it&#x2019;s impossible for them to be truly impartial, since they owe them everything, including their lives&#x2014;�but they can try to impose some order on their story, restore the meaning that gets stolen away by the petty events of life and their accumulation, and then they can protect that story and perpetuate it in their memory. Children are policemen of their parents, but I don&#x2019;t like policemen. They&#x2019;ve never gotten along well with my family.<br><br>2<br><br>My father got sick at the end of those years, in August 2008. One day, probably on her birthday, I called my paternal grandmother. She told me not to worry, that they&#x2019;d taken my father to the hospital only for a routine checkup. I asked her what she was talking about. A routine checkup, nothing important, replied my grandmother; I don&#x2019;t know why it&#x2019;s taking so long, but it&#x2019;s not important. I asked her how long my father had been in the hospital. Two days, three, she answered. When I hung up with her, I called my parents&#x2019; house. No one was there. Then I called my sister. A voice answered that seemed to come from the depths of time, the voice of everyone who has ever waited for news in a hospital hallway, a voice of tiredness and desperation. We didn&#x2019;t want to worry you, my sister told me. What happened? I asked. Well, answered my sister, it&#x2019;s too complicated to explain to you now. Can I talk to him? I asked. No, he can&#x2019;t talk, she replied. I&#x2019;m coming, I said, and I hung up.<br><br>4<br><br>My father and I hadn&#x2019;t spoken in some time. It wasn&#x2019;t anything personal, I just didn&#x2019;t usually have a telephone on hand when I wanted to talk to him and he didn&#x2019;t have anywhere to call me if he ever wanted to. A few months before he got sick, I left the room I&#x2019;d been renting in that German city and started sleeping on the couches of people I knew. I didn&#x2019;t do it because I was broke, but for the feeling of irresponsibility that I assumed came with not having a home or obligations, with leaving everything behind. And honestly it wasn&#x2019;t bad, but the problem is, when you live like that you can&#x2019;t have many possessions, so gradually I parted with my books, with the few objects I&#x2019;d bought since arriving in Germany and with my clothes; all I held on to were some shirts, because I discovered that a clean shirt can open doors for you when you have nowhere to go. I usually washed them by hand in the morning while I showered and then let them dry inside one of the lockers at the library in the literature department of the university where I worked, or on the grass in a park where I used to go to kill time before searching out the hospitality and companionship of the owner of some sofa. I was just passing through.<br><br>5<br><br>Sometimes I couldn&#x2019;t sleep; when that happened, I&#x2019;d get up off the sofa and walk toward my host&#x2019;s bookshelves, always different but also always, without fail, located beside the sofa, as if reading were possible only in the perpetual discomfort of that piece of furniture in which one is neither properly seated nor completely stretched out. Then I would look at the books and think how I used to read them one right after the next but how at that point they left me completely cold. On those bookshelves there were almost never books by those dead writers I&#x2019;d read when I was a poor teenager in a poor neighborhood of a poor city in a poor country, and I was stupidly insistent on becoming part of that imaginary republic to which they belonged, a republic with vague borders in which writers wrote in New York or in London, in Berlin or in Buenos Aires, and yet I wasn&#x2019;t of that world. I had wanted to be like them, and the only proof that remained of that determination, and the resolve that came with it, was that trip to Germany, the country where the writers that most interested me had lived and had died and, above all, had written, and a fistful of books that already belonged to a literature I had tried and failed to escape; a literature like the nightmare of a dying writer, or, better yet, of a dying, talentless Argentine writer; of a writer, let&#x2019;s say, who is not the author of The Aleph, around whom we all inevitably revolve, but rather the author of On Heroes and Tombs, someone who spent his whole life believing that he was talented and important and morally unquestionable and who at the very end discovers that he&#x2019;s completely without talent and behaved ridiculously and brunched with dictators, and then he feels ashamed and wants his country&#x2019;s literature to be at the level of his miserable body of work so that it wasn&#x2019;t written in vain and might even have one or two followers. Well, I had been part of that literature, and every time I thought about it, it was as if in my head an old man was shouting Tornado! Tornado! announcing the end of days, as in a Mexican film I had once seen; except that the days had kept coming and I had been able to grab onto the trunks of those trees that remained standing in the tornado only by quitting writing, completely quitting writing and reading, and by seeing books for what they were, the only thing that I&#x2019;d ever been able to call my home, but complete strangers in that time of pills and vivid dreams in which I no longer remembered nor wanted to remember what a damn home was.</p><h2>The Laughing River: A Folktale for Peace (book)(Folktales for Peace, V. 1)</h2><p>Two fanciful African tribes -- the Funga &amp; Alafia -- are in conflict until the laughing river bubbles melodiously into their lives, bringing fun, friendship and peace.

As manager of the board, the chair joins the CEO in responsibility for advancing the mission, partnering with the vision, governing by policy, and setting the tone for the morale of the ministry. Such leadership requires a chair who is appointed by God, gifted with integrity, trust and humility, and anointed by the Holy Spirit. With deft strokes written out of learning from professional practice, understanding from spiritual discipline, and insight from personal experience, David McKenna leaves no doubt. Unless chosen by God, the chair will fail; unless gifted with integrity, trust and humility, the board will fail; and unless obedient to the Spirit, the ministry will fail. Loud and clear, the message is sent to every Christ-centered ministry: The call of the chair is the call of God.</p><p>David McKenna is retired as President of Spring Arbor University, Seattle Pacific University, and Asbury Theological Seminary as well as Chair of the Board at Spring Arbor University and Bakke Graduate School of Theology. Before and after retirement, he served as consultant for board development and presidential search at such institutions as Wheaton College, Gordon College, Messiah University, Asbury University, Huntington University, National Association of Evangelicals, and the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities.

Hard cover, 208 pp. [Excerpt from jacket flap]. Southern California, although known worldwide through the media of news and entertainment, has to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Los Angeles is the heart and soul of Southern California, and epitomizes the strange mix of stunning light, fast-paced freeways, and exhilarating art that can be found nowhere else in the world. LA is arguably one of the most important cities in the world for art, and the artists who live there frequently defy the conventional categorization that is commonplace in other locations of cutting-edge contemporary art. Painters, sculptors, printmakers, and photographers can be found in their thousands, but there are also performance artists, installation artists, and mixed-media artists. This book delves into the influences and forces that have shaped this region since the early 1980s, and introduces the reader to both internationally recognized and lesser known but, perhaps, no less important - artists and their art. It is an indispensable guide and reference for anyone interested in knowing more about the key players in one of the world&#39;s most significant art markets.</p><p></p><h2>Pretty Party Cakes: Sweet and Stylish Cakes and Cookies for All Occasions</h2><p>A romantic Three-Column Wedding Cake adorned with fresh roses; eye-catching Kalei-doscope Cakes iced in geometric designs; glittering Bollywood-inspired lollipop cookies&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t have to go to a high-end bakery to be able to serve these beautiful desserts at your next party.

A self-proclaimed creation of Jim Morrison, Courson was a complex and compelling woman who lived several roles in her relationship with the Doors lead singer: groupie, muse, and wife, to name a few. <i>Angels Dance</i> examines the lives of Courson and Morrison before their fateful meeting in 1965; it chronicles their lives together until Morrisons death in 1971; and it describes Coursons life without Morrison, including her fight to gain the rights to his estate until her death from a heroin overdose on April 25, 1974.</p><p>Patricia Butler is a freelance writer based in the Chicago area.How one views this gossamer-thin account of the doomed Doors frontman and his equally troubled common-law wife rests largely on one's (forgive the expression) ``perception of the Doors.'' This book will be tonic to those eager for more dish on the man they regard as the Rimbaud-esque cynosure of the angst-filled '60s generation. Those baffled by Morrison's fame--particularly the respect he received as a poet--will find this book supports, quite unintentionally, their contentions as well. It's not that Butler didn't do her homework; among the people she interviewed and sources she consulted are the Elektra Records A&amp;R tyro Jac Holzman and the surviving members of the Doors, school and police records, and even medical journals. The problem rests chiefly with Butler's subject. This story has in large part been told many times before, from many angles, and often to better effect. Readers, whether Doors fans or not, will have a tough time piecing events together chronologically, as this narrative only sketchily covers the background events that shaped and defined Jim and Pam's world. Additionally, Butler seems to cast a sentimental and too often uncritical eye on the ``tragic lovers' '' relationship, neglecting to acknowledge that the two were essentially beautiful booze- and drug-addled twentysomethings with money to burn, and that their fatal flaw was not so much being at odds with the material world as it was never having been forced to confront it without help from agents, roadies, groupies, or sycophants. The Doors' keyboardist and co- founder (with Jim), Ray Manzarek, claims that Pamela and Jim will ``go down in history as great lovers,'' and that their tale recalls Romeo and Juliet, Heloise and Abelard. Perhaps one could argue that a more fitting, albeit less flattering, comparison might be Sid (Vicious) and Nancy (Spungeon). -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

By his meticulous research, Duffy has discovered many original documents and records during his academic career, proving that his thesis about the Reformation is basically irrefutable.</p><p>This book is illustrated by a small collection of full color plates which further demonstrate the richness of late medieval religion.</p></p><p><b>Professor Eamon Duffy</b> is Emeritus Professor of the History of Christianity at the University of Cambridge.

The problem is, his beliefs don&#x2019;t fall within any of the categories. Silas believes that selflessness enlarges vision and that what a person should strive for is to be overcome by the beyond. He believes in honoring otherness and in giving questions credence over certainty. He calls himself a Cosmoterian because his goal is to make himself worthy of the majesty of Cosmos. Silas is a man driven by big ideas, but it is the everyday smallness that perpetually both intrigues and eludes him.<br><br>In this emotional tale of haunted love, Silas finds himself locked in a marriage descending toward darkness until the arrival of his sister-in-law and soon thereafter the appearance of a witching neighbor who may or may not be alive.

Its pages were filled with racy stories, sex scandals, and political expos�s. It offered advice about the dangers of cigarettes and advocated various medical remedies. Its circulation, at the height of its popularity, was three million. It was first published in 1952 and took the country by storm. <br>&nbsp;<br>Readers loved its lurid red-and-yellow covers; its sensational stories filled with innuendo and titillating details; its articles that went far beyond most movie magazines, like <i>Photoplay</i> and <i>Modern Screen,</i> and told the real stories such trade publications as <i>Variety</i> and the <i>Hollywood Reporter</i> couldn&#x2019;t, since they, and the movie magazines, were financially dependent on&#x2014;or controlled by&#x2014;the Hollywood studios. <br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Confidential&#x2019;</i>s pages, homespun America was revealed as it really was: our most sacrosanct movie stars and heroes were exposed as wife beaters (Bing Crosby), homosexuals (Rock Hudson and Liberace), neglectful mothers (Rita Hayworth), sex obsessives (June Allyson, the cutie with the page boy and Peter Pan collar), mistresses of the rich and dangerous (Kim Novak, lover of Ramfis Trujillo, playboy son of the Dominican Republic dictator).&nbsp; <br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Confidential&#x2019;</i>s alliterative headlines told of tawny temptresses (black women passing for white), pinko partisans (liberals), lisping lads (homosexuals) . . . and promised its readers what the newspapers wouldn&#x2019;t<br>reveal: &#x201c;The Real Reason for Marilyn Monroe&#x2019;s Divorce&#x201d; . . .

Scott</strong> <br> <br> <b>Question:</b> <i>Shocking True Story</i> is a full, behind-the-scenes look at the original scandal magazine that started it all--<i>Confidential</i>. You first came to this story, as you share in your acknowledgements, through another title, James Ellroy&#x2019;s <i>L.A. Confidential</i>. How did that book start everything, and where did it take you?<p></p> <p><b>Henry E. Scott:</b> I picked up James Ellroy's <i>L.A. Confidential</i> at an airport bookstore before boarding a flight several years ago from New York City to Istanbul. I was so captivated by Ellroy's book that I spent my first two days holed up in my hotel, finishing <i>L.A. Confidential</i>, before venturing out to explore exotic Istanbul. When I got back to New York, the one thing I wanted to know more about was <i>Confidential</i> magazine, which had a small supporting role in Ellroy&#x2019;s tale. To my amazement, I couldn&#x2019;t find a book about <i>Confidential</i>. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine anything more fun than writing one.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> In telling the story of <i>Confidential</i>, <i>Shocking True Story</i> is populated with over-the-top characters--private eyes, movie stars, politicians, moguls--and of course scandal and intrigue of every kind. In all of this, two figures stand out--Robert Harrison, the publisher, and Howard Rushmore, one of the magazine&#x2019;s most important editors. What were they like and how were they drawn in to this world?</p> <p><b>Henry E. Scott:</b> Harrison, <i>Confidential</i>'s founder and publisher, and Rushmore, its best-known editor, fascinated me because they were such complete opposites. Harrison was the son of immigrants--Russian Jews fleeing the pogroms of the 1890s; Rushmore bragged that his family traced its ancestry to the Pilgrims. Harrison was a social butterfly, out at clubs with chorus girls on his arm; Rushmore had few friends. Harrison was part of a big family, while Rushmore was an only child. Harrison reveled in the celebrity and notoriety that <i>Confidential</i> brought him; Rushmore appreciated the size of the magazine&#x2019;s audience, but much of its content embarrassed him. What they had in common was both were on a quest for fame that led to a collision that ultimately destroyed <i>Confidential</i>. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> <i>Confidential</i> featured pieces on all of the major movie stars of the time--Marilyn Monroe, Rock Hudson, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and so on. As you mentioned earlier, these weren&#x2019;t stories planted or approved by the movie studios, but written in defiance of those studios and the often false images of their stars that they were trying to promote. Among all these stories was there any <i>Confidential</i> piece that shocked you?</p> <p><b>Henry E. Scott:</b> I was quite surprised to discover that "outing,&#x201d; or disclosing that someone was gay against his will, was a common practice at <i>Confidential</i>. Most of us think of outing as something that started in the '90s, when gay activists exposed the sexual orientation of those closeted gays who they thought opposed gay rights. But <i>Confidential</i>, sometimes bluntly and sometimes by suggestion, wrote about the gay lives of people as varied as Tab Hunter, Marlene Dietrich, and Walter Chrysler Jr., heir to the automobile fortune.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> You have worked at the <i>New York Times</i> and continue to work in the media today--do you look at our current media moment any differently after learning all you did about <i>Confidential</i>? Where do you see us heading?</p> <p><b>Henry E. Scott:</b> I think <i>Confidential</i>&#x2019;s strategy of exploiting American fears is flourishing today on television, in certain print publications, and certainly online. The wacky idea that the health care bill proposed "death panels" is something I could see <i>Confidential</i> writing about. And the sexual indiscretions of conservative Republican congressmen would have been a major <i>Confidential</i> cover story. As the French say, the more things change, the more they remain the same. The only difference is <i>Confidential</i>&#x2019;s editorial formula is now found everywhere.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> The book features many original articles from the magazine--what was your favorite one?</p> <p><b>Henry E.

Warren's dramatic death over 40 years ago is famous: he collapsed and died onstage at the Met on March 4, 1960 in a performance as Carlo in <i>La forza del destino</i>. In this definitive biography, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, author of an acclaimed biography of Giuseppe Verdi, offers an intimate portrait of a beloved opera star, based on hundreds of interviews. More than 100 rare photographs capture Warren in his great roles as well as in private moments. HARDCOVER.</p><p>Mary Jane Phillips-Matz is the author of <i>Verdi: A Biography, Rosa Ponselle, American Diva</i>, and other books about opera. A contributor to <i>Opera News, Opera Quarterly, BBC Music Magazine</i> and many other publications, she is also a cofounder and executive board member of the American Institute for Verdi Studies at New York University. For <i>Verdi: A Biography</i>, she won the Royal Philharmonic Society Award and the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award. She lives in New York City.To many opera lovers, Leonard Warren was the greatest baritone of the 20th century. The Bronx-born son of Russian immigrants had extraordinary flexibility and control of dynamics, and the great Verdi rolesDRigoletto, Scarpia, Amonasro, IagoDseemed to have been written for his big, powerful voice. This exhaustive, occasionally repetitive biography appears in time for the 40th anniversary of the singer's dramatic death, onstage during a performance of La forza del destino at New York City's Metropolitan Opera. Phillips-Matz, a frequent contributor to Opera News and Opera Quarterly and the Royal Philharmonic Society Award-winning author of Verdi (Oxford Univ., 1993), provides a wealth of detail about the singer's personal and professional life along with valuable supplemental materials.

In a foxhole in Bastogne, Belgium, the innocent yet charmingly clever protagonist, Corporal Tom Cole, is injured. Wilder moves the action to a romantic wartime London with dimly lit blackout-compliant restaurants and mad dashes to the Tube station at the sound of the air raid sirens where Cole convalesces and falls in love for the first time. But is the mysterious Danish girl he meets at the Shepherdess Caf� on the up and up? Cole is a cellist back home in the States, and Anna says she's a monitor at the War Office, scanning radio waves for incoming German planes. But is she? When Cole goes to the War Office one day to surprise his new lover, she's nowhere to be found.</p><p>Wilder's story takes Cole on a quest for the woman he loves but no longer trusts, and ultimately parachutes him, a newly minted intelligence officer, behind enemy lines into a concentration camp to save her life and discover the truth.</p></p><p><b>Gene Wilder (1933-2016) </b>began acting when he was thirteen and writing for the screen since the early 1970s. After a small role in Bonnie and Clyde pulled him away from a career onstage, he was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for his role as Leo Bloom in The Producers, which led to Blazing Saddles and then to another Academy nomination, this time for writing Young Frankenstein. Wilder has appeared in twenty-five feature films and a number of stage productions. His first book, about his own life, was <i>Kiss Me Like A Stranger,</i> and was followed by the novels <i>My French Whore, The Woman Who Wouldn&#x2019;t , What Is This Thing Called Love?</i> and S<i>omething to Remember You By.</i>ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>Bastogne&#x2014;December 25th, 1944&#x2014;A white and red Christmas</i> <br>At 3:00 a.m. they woke in their foxhole after the ground shook from the explosions that had started up again. The water in their canteens had frozen. Because of Nazi flares the soldiers in the foxhole could see that they were surrounded by a blanket of snow. Yesterday, Cpl. Tom Cole, their medic, poured disinfectant into the stomach wound of Private Papales and then bandaged him, but the private was still bleeding. Their sergeant had been killed and Privates Lancy and Eggert were bleeding from rifle shots to their chests, their clothes wet from the snow and their faces freezing. <br>At the first sign of dawn, they heard the Nazi tanks starting to roll again. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll never get out alive, will we?&#x201d; Private Papales asked softly, crying like the young boy he was. Tom Cole held the boy&#x2019;s hand but didn&#x2019;t answer. <br>Private Steen, who had not been wounded, screamed his lungs out at the approaching tanks, as if they could hear him: &#x201c;Fucking Nazis&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t wanna die like this!&#x201d; <br>The tanks drove back and forth over all the foxholes they could see, trying to crush the men inside, until a huge morning fog settled over the whole area. It allowed the 501st Paratroop Division to move in with their bazookas without the Nazis seeing them. When the bazookas started firing, the Nazi tanks left as fast as they could. Cheers rang out from all the scattered foxholes like a hundred-man chorus. Tom lifted himself up and thought the coast was clear enough to get his wounded men out of the stinking hole they were in. He lifted Private Papales out and laid him flat on the ground, telling him, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to make it now, Timmy.&#x201d; <br>Tom went back into the foxhole and started to lift Private Lancy, who was still bleeding terribly, but a German tank suddenly came from out of nowhere and ran over Private Papales. Tom crawled up and looked at the private&#x2019;s crushed body and head. Tom then pushed his own head into the young boy&#x2019;s body and couldn&#x2019;t stop crying. <br>&#x201c;Forgive me, forgive me,&#x201d; he whispered. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Gene Wilder <br></p><h2>Helen Clay Frick: Bittersweet Heiress</h2><p><p>In 1919, at the age of thirty-one, Helen Clay Frick inherited $38 million, becoming the richest single woman in America. These riches, however, came at a price. Helen's tumultuous early life was shaped by her father's infamy as a union strikebreaker and the ensuing attempt on his life, her mother's debilitating depression, and the death of her older sister and newborn brother about a year apart. Despite these events, Helen built a luminous legacy through her lifelong commitment to social welfare, the environment, and a supreme devotion to the visual arts.</p><p>Helen's philanthropy touched the lives of thousands. Her contributions included a vacation home for young female textile workers, two wildlife preserves, one a public wilderness park, a Victorian-era house museum, a pre-Civil War historic Mennonite village, a university fine arts department, two art history libraries, and the purchase of many significant works of art for her private collection, the Frick Collection in New York, the University of Pittsburgh teaching collection, and the Frick Art Museum.</p><p>Through extensive period research and singular access to Frick family archives and Helen Clay Frick's personal writings, Martha Frick Symington Sanger fashions a multifaceted portrait of a complex, often misunderstood, yet indomitable humanitarian, philanthropist, and cultural force in twentieth-century America.</p></p><p><p><b>Martha Frick Symington Sanger</b> is the author of <i>Henry Clay Frick: An Intimate Portrait</i> (1998), which was cited in August 2007 in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> by Carnegie Corporation president Vartan Gregorian as one of the &#x201c;five best&#x201d; books detailing the lives and contributions of great philanthropists in America&#x2019;s gilded age.

Algorithmic high-speed supercomputing has replaced traditional floor trading and human market makers, while centralized exchanges that once ensured fairness and transparency have fragmented into a dizzying array of competing exchanges and trading platforms. <i>Darkness by Design</i> exposes the unseen perils of market fragmentation and &#x201c;dark&#x201d; markets, some of which are deliberately designed to enable the transfer of wealth from the weak to the powerful.</p><p>Walter Mattli traces the fall of the traditional exchange model of the NYSE, the world&#x2019;s leading stock market in the twentieth century, showing how it has come to be supplanted by fragmented markets whose governance is frequently set up to allow unscrupulous operators to exploit conflicts of interest at the expense of an unsuspecting public. Market makers have few obligations, market surveillance is neglected or impossible, enforcement is ineffective, and new technologies are not necessarily used to improve oversight but to offer lucrative preferential market access to select clients in ways that are often hidden. Mattli argues that power politics is central in today&#x2019;s fragmented markets. He sheds critical light on how the redistribution of power and influence has created new winners and losers in capital markets and lays the groundwork for sensible reforms to combat shady trading schemes and reclaim these markets for the long-term benefit of everyone.</p><p>Essential reading for anyone with money in the stock market, <i>Darkness by Design</i> challenges the conventional view of markets and reveals the troubling implications of unchecked market power for the health of the global economy and society as a whole.</p></p><p><b>Walter Mattli</b> is professor of international political economy and a fellow of St. John&#x2019;s College, University of Oxford.

Mattli&#x2019;s sets a high standard."<b>---David Murphy, <i>Open Letters Review</i></b><br><br>"Walter Mattli's excellent book looks at the technological revolution that led to the fragmentation of today's security exchanges and trading floors.

Reprint.</p><p>Young Kitty Charing stands to inherit a vast fortune from her irascible great-uncle Matthew--provided she marries one of her cousins. Kitty is not wholly adverse to the plan, <i>if</i> the right nephew proposes. Unfortunately, Kitty has set her heart on Jack Westruther, a confirmed rake, who seems to have no inclination to marry her anytime soon. In an effort to make Jack jealous, <i>and</i> to see a little more of the world than her isolated life on her great-uncle's estate has afforded her, Kitty devises a plan. She convinces yet another of her cousins, the honorable Freddy Standen, to pretend to be engaged to her. Her plan would bring her to London on a visit to Freddy's family and (hopefully) render the elusive Mr. Westruther madly jealous. Thus begins <i>Cotillion</i>, arguably the funniest, most charming of Georgette Heyer's many delightful Regency romances. <p> No sooner does Kitty arrive in London than she becomes embroiled in the romantic difficulties of several new acquaintances. Kitty's French cousin, Camille, a professional gambler, has won the heart of her new friend, Olivia--who also happens to be the object of Jack Westruther's dishonorable intentions. Meanwhile, Kitty's doltish cousin Lord Dolphinton has fallen in love with a merchant's daughter who's embattled with his mother and needs his help. Finally, there is Kitty herself, who begins to wonder if the dandified Freddy might not be the man for her after all. As in all of Georgette Heyer's books, <i>Cotillion</i> transcends genre--it is, quite simply, wonderful literature. Historically accurate down to the finest details of dress, deportment, and speech, Heyer was also a master at creating unforgettable, comic characters, and Kitty Charing and Freddy Standen stand out as one of her most charming romantic duos ever.</p>"Sparkling" -Independent on Sunday <br>A most unusual hero<br>Freddy is immensely rich, of course, and not bad-looking, but he's mild-mannered, a bit hapless-not anything like his virile, handsome, rakish cousin Jack? <br>A heroine in a difficult situation<br>Young Kitty Charing stands to inherit a vast fortune from her irascible and eccentric guardian-provided she marries one of his great-nephews? <br>A sham betrothal <br>No sooner does Kitty arrive in London then the race for her hand begins, but between confirmed rakes and bumbling affections, Kitty needs a daring scheme? <br>"Thus begins Cotillion, arguably the funniest, most charming of Georgette Heyer's many delightful Regency romances."<br>-Amazon.co.uk <br>"Triumphantly good?Georgette Heyer is unbeatable." <br>-Sunday Telegraph <br>"My favourite historical novelist." -Margaret Drabble <br>Georgette Heyer is the author of over fifty books and one of the best-known and best-loved historical novelists.

It failed to do so and this text aims to reveal that important failures in its handling originated in conflicting styles of command and different understandings of the rules of the game.

This cadre of activists included Phoebe Hearst, the mother of William Randolph Hearst; Grace Dodge, granddaughter of Wall Street "Merchant Prince" William Earle Dodge; and Ava Belmont, who married into the Vanderbilt family fortune. Motivated by their own experiences with sexism, and focusing on women's need for economic independence, these benefactors sought to expand women's access to higher education, promote suffrage, and champion reproductive rights, as well as to provide assistance to working-class women. In a time when women still wielded limited political power, philanthropy was perhaps the most potent tool they had. But even as these wealthy women exercised considerable influence, their activism had significant limits. As Johnson argues, restrictions tied to their giving engendered resentment and jeopardized efforts to establish coalitions across racial and class lines.<br> <br>As the struggle for full economic and political power and self-determination for women continues today, this history reveals how generous women helped shape the movement. And Johnson shows us that tensions over wealth and power that persist in the modern movement have deep historical roots.<br><br></p><p>Joan Marie Johnson is a historian and Director for Faculty in the Office of the Provost at Northwestern University.With <i>Funding Feminism</i>, Joan Marie Johnson makes a significant contribution to U.S. women's history.

Even today, Brazil is a nation of almost unimaginable distance between its wealthy and its poor, a place of extraordinary levels of crime and violence. It is also one of the most beautiful and seductive places on earth. Using the art, food and the books of its great nineteenth-century writer, Machado de Assis, Robb takes us on a journey into a world like Conrad&#39;s &#34;Nostromo&#34;. A world so absurdly dramatic, like the current president Lula&#39;s fight for power, that it could have come from one of the country&#39;s immensely popular TV soap operas, a world where resolution is often only provided by death.

It is written <em>about</em> teens, sure, but the themes are so universal that anyone who survived high school will relate to the lives of the two protagonists. Eleanor is the new girl in town and her wild red hair and patchwork outfits are not helping her blend in. She ends up sitting next to Park on the bus, whose tendencies towards comic books don&#x2019;t jibe with the rest of his family&#x2019;s love of sports. They sit in awkward silence every day until Park notices that Eleanor is reading his comics over his shoulder; he begins to slide them closer to her side of the seat and thus begins their love story. Their relationship grows gradually--making each other mixed tapes (it is 1986 after all) and discussing <em>X-Men</em> characters--until they both find themselves looking forward to the bus ride more than any other part of the day. Things aren&#x2019;t easy: Eleanor is bullied at school and then goes home to a threatening family situation; Park&#x2019;s parents do not approve of Eleanor&#x2019;s awkward ways. Ultimately, though, this is a book about two people who just really, really like each other and who believe that they can overcome any obstacle standing in the way of their happiness. It&#x2019;s a gem of a book. <em>--Caley Anderson</em><p>Rainbow Rowell writes books. Sometimes she writes about adults (<i>Attachments</i> and <i>Landline</i>).

Over the course of this meteoric rise, he made his share of enemies and feuded with nearly every member of his family.</p><p>In <em>The King of Content</em>, Keach Hagey deconstructs Redstone&#x2019;s rise from Boston&#x2019;s West End through Harvard Law School to the highest echelons of American business. Today the ninety-five-year-old mogul&#x2019;s life has become a tabloid soap opera, the center of acrimonious legal battles throughout his vast holdings, which include Paramount Pictures and two of the largest public media companies, Viacom and CBS. At the heart of these lawsuits is Redstone&#x2019;s tumultuous love life and complicated relationship with his children. Redstone&#x2019;s daughter, Shari, has emerged as his de facto successor, but only after she ousted his closest confidant in a fierce power struggle.</p><p>Yet Redstone&#x2019;s assets face an existential threat that goes beyond his family, disgruntled ex-girlfriends, or even the management of his companies: the changing nature of media consumption. As more and more people cut their cable cords, CBS, with its focus on sports and broadcast TV, has held steady, while Viacom, with its once-great cable channels like MTV and Nickelodeon, has suffered a precipitous fall. As their rivals merge, the question is whether Shari&#x2019;s push to undo her father&#x2019;s last big strategic maneuver and recombine CBS and Viacom will be enough to shore up their future.</p><p>A biography and corporate whodunit filled with surprising details, <em>The King of Content</em> investigates Redstone&#x2019;s impact on business and popular culture, as well as the family feuds, corporate battles, and questionable alliances that go back decades&#x2014;all laid bare in this authoritative book.</p></p><p><p>Keach Hagey is a reporter at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>,<em> </em>covering television and large media companies.

Yet it is an epic story that takes a book to examine, one filled with legal conflicts, boardroom battles, angry ex-girlfriends, family drama and a 95-year-old media mogul whose health, Hagey wrote in April in the Wall Street Journal, where she is a reporter, &#x201c;has declined so significantly he cannot speak much beyond grunts.&#x201d; It also promises more than just the tabloid soap opera business story, but a look at how much media consumption and its industry is changing.&#x201d; (Washington Post)</p><h2>Citizen of the World: The Life of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Volume One: 1919-1968</h2><p>One of the most important, exciting biographies of our time: the definitive, major two-volume biography of Pierre Elliott Trudeau &#x2013; written with unprecedented, complete access to Trudeau&#x2019;s enormous cache of private letters and papers.<br><br>Bestselling biographer John English gets behind the public record and existing glancing portraits of Trudeau to reveal the real man and the multiple influences that shaped his life, providing the full context lacking in all previous biographies to-date. <br><br>As prime minister between 1968 and 1984, Trudeau, the brilliant, controversial figure, intrigued Canadians and attracted international attention as no other Canadian leader has ever done. Volume One takes us from his birth in 1919 to his election as leader in 1968.<br><br>Born into a wealthy family in Montreal, Trudeau excelled at the best schools, graduating as a lawyer with conservative, nationalist and traditional Catholic views. But always conscious of his French-English heritage, desperate to know the outside world, and an adventurer to boot, he embarked on a pilgrimage of discovery &#x2013; first to Harvard and the Sorbonne, then to the London School of Economics and, finally, on a trip through Europe, the Middle East, India and China. He was a changed man when he returned &#x2013; socialist in his politics, sympathetic to labour, a friend to activists and writers in radical causes. Suddenly and surprisingly, he went to Ottawa for two mostly unhappy years as a public servant in the Privy Council Office. He frequently shocked his colleagues when, on the brink of a Quebec election, for example, he departed for New York or Europe on an extended tour. Yet in the 1950s and 60s, he wrote the most important articles outlining his political philosophy.<br><br>And there were the remarkable relationships with friends, women and especially his mother (whom he lived with until he was middle-aged). He wrote to them always, exchanging ideas with the men, intimacies with the women, especially in these early years, and lively descriptions of his life. He even recorded his in-depth psychoanalysis in Paris. This personal side of Trudeau has never been revealed before &#x2013; and it sheds light on the politician and statesman he became.<br><br>Volume One ends with his entry into politics, his appointment as Minister of Justice, his meeting Margaret and his election as leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister of Canada. There, his genius and charisma, his ambition and intellectual prowess, his ruthlessness and emotional character and his deliberate shaping of himself for leadership played out on the national stage and, when Lester B. Pearson announced his retirement as prime minister in 1968, there was but one obvious man for the job: Pierre Trudeau.<br><br><i>In 1938 Trudeau began a diary, which he continued for over two years. It is detailed, frank, and extraordinarily revealing. It is the only diary in Trudeau&#x2019;s papers, apart from less personal travel diaries and an agenda for 1937 that contains some commentary. His diary expresses Trudeau&#x2019;s own need to chronicle the moments of late adolescence as he tried to find his identity. It begins on New Year&#x2019;s Day 1938 with the intriguing advice: &#x201c;If you want to know my thoughts, read between the lines!&#x201d;</i><br>&#x2013;from <b>Citizen of the World</b></p><p>John English, a professor of history at the University of Waterloo and former MP, is the author of the acclaimed two-volume biography of Lester Pearson, <b>The Worldly Years: The Life of Lester Pearson, Vol. 1:1949&#x2014;1972</b>, and <b>Shadow of Heaven: The Life of Lester B. Pearson Vol. 2</b>, along with several other books on Canadian politics.<b>Chapter One<br> <br>Two Worlds</b><br><br>The Great War was over; the times tasted bitter. Influenza came back with the soldiers and killed more at home than had died in the trenches. Like the war, it preferred the young to the old. Death usually came quickly as the victims suffocated in a blood-tinged froth that sometimes gushed grotesquely from their faces. As winter became spring in 1919, theatres stayed empty. Men and women entered public places warily, concealing their faces behind gauze masks. The plague invaded private spaces, compelling isolation and reflection. What, then, did Grace Elliott Trudeau and her husband, Joseph-Charles-�mile, think when she learned she was pregnant in Montreal in mid-winter 1919? Pregnancy was dangerous in normal times, but the influenza surely terrified her as her body began to swell with her second child.<br><br>The twentieth century had so far been a great disappointment &#x2013; especially for francophone Canadians. There was some excitement and hope when it began with Canada&#x2019;s first French-speaking prime minister, Wilfrid Laurier, in power, and an increasingly prosperous economy. The great transformation of Western society that occurred as electricity, steamships, telephones, railways, and automobiles upset the balance of the Victorian age profoundly affected the world of the young Trudeaus. In Quebec, as elsewhere, people were in motion, leaving the familiar fields of rural life and traditional crafts for the cities that were exploding beyond their pre-industrial core. In Montreal, the population rose from 267,730 in 1901 to 618,506 in 1921. The rich had clustered together, initially in mansions in the &#x201c;Golden Square Mile&#x201d; along Sherbrooke Street and north up the southern slope of Mount Royal, while the poor spread out below them and in the east end. It was said in 1900 that the Square Mile contained three-quarters of Canada&#x2019;s millionaires. Stephen Leacock, who knew them well, commented, &#x201c;The rich in Montreal enjoyed a prestige in that era that not even the rich deserve.&#x201d;<br><br>Unfortunately, the rich were nearly entirely English; the poor, overwhelmingly French. When the French lived mainly in the villages, the gap was less obvious. In the city, it sowed the seeds of deep discontent. And, as new immigrants, mainly Jewish, flowed in from continental Europe, new tensions emerged in the more diverse city.<br><br>Even before the war, foreign visitors sensed trouble. In 1911 the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, after a visit to Montreal, said that all reasonable men should advise the French to abandon their resistance to assimilation. They were fast becoming simply an episode in history.4 Among francophones in Quebec, the challenge of the new century brought an increasingly nationalist response, particularly when English-Canadian politicians became entangled in the British imperialism that marked the years before the Great War. By then there was a new prime minister, Robert Borden, and the voice of French Canada in the federal government became faint. And in 1914 the war divided the country as never before between the French and the others.<br><br>Once again, it seemed that a bargain had been broken. Now leader of the official Opposition, Wilfrid Laurier supported the war, along with the French Catholic Church. Even Henri Bourassa, who had founded the nationalist newspaper Le Devoir and become the vocal spokesperson for francophone rights throughout Canada, kept his silence. He and the bishops went along because Borden promised there would be no conscription, but, three years later, conscription was proclaimed, accompanied by vitriolic attacks in English Canada on the French in Quebec. In the bitter and violent Canadian election in 1917, francophones voted overwhelmingly for Laurier&#x2019;s Liberals, who opposed conscription, while anglophones responded by backing a coalition composed of English-speaking Liberals and Conservatives. There were riots in Montreal and deaths in Quebec City. In 1919 Laurier died, then depression struck, while, at Versailles, the victors divided the spoils even as the world began to understand that the war to end all wars had not done so.<br><br>In their modest but comfortable row home at 5779 Durocher Avenue in the new suburb of Outremont, the Trudeaus could find some comfort. Outremont was neighbour to Mount Royal and, in population, split between residents of French and British origin, along with a substantial number of Jews. They lived far from the crowded tenements of the city below the hill, where death often came for both mother and child during pregnancy.5 Charles and Grace had married on May 11, 1915, and she had become pregnant soon after with an infant who did not survive.6 In 1918 she gave birth to a daughter, Suzette. Charles already had good reason not to enlist and, after the Military Service Act became law in 1917, to avoid conscription.<br><br>When the Trudeaus married, Grace, in common with other Quebec women of the time, acquired the same legal rights as minors and idiots. Her husband owed her protection in return for her submission. Yet Grace had her own sources of strength. Her father, a substantial businessman of United Empire Loyalist stock, had sent his daughter to Dunham Ladies&#x2019; College in the Eastern Townships, where she had acquired an education in literature, classics, and etiquette that few girls in Quebec possessed. She knew French, her mother&#x2019;s tongue, as well as English, which she and Charles chose to speak most often at home. Like Charles, she was Roman Catholic and devout.Though not wealthy in the first years of their marriage, the Trudeaus had the means to hire country girls to help with household tasks.<br><br>Assisted by a midwife at home, Grace gave birth to Joseph-Philippe-Pierre-Yves-Elliott Trudeau on a warm fall day, October 18, 1919. The parents immediately chose Pierre from his multiple names, though he, later, took a long time to make up his mind which name he favoured. His mother probably reflected the original intention when she wrote in his &#x201c;Baby Book&#x201d; Joseph Pierre Yves Philip Elliott Trudeau. Years later, when he was quizzed about it, Trudeau himself could not recall the correct order.He weighed eight pounds four ounces and, from the beginning, suffered from colic. The crying finally stopped when he had an operation for adenoids in May 1920. Along with Pierre&#x2019;s physical health, Grace recorded his spiritual growth in a diary. It began with his baptism, followed by the moment in October 1921 when two-year-old &#x201c;Pierre made the sign of the cross.&#x201d; In December he began to say his prayers alone and &#x201c;blessed Papa, Mama, Suzette etc.&#x201d;Six months later the proud mother recorded that her precociously bilingual child knew &#x201c;Sing a Song of Sixpence,&#x201d; &#x201c;Little Jack Horner,&#x201d; &#x201c;Au clair de la lune,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Dans sa cabane.&#x201d; She continued dutifully to collect mementos of Pierre&#x2019;s life &#x2013; school essays, marks, news clippings, and letters&#x2013;until he finally left her home in the 1960s as a middle-aged man.</p><h2>Falling Like Snowflakes (A Summer Harbor Novel)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Hunter is a master romance storyteller. <em>Falling Like Snowflakes</em> is charming and fun with a twist of mystery and intrigue.

Noting that Hungary has produced some of the world's most renowned artists, scientists, and financiers as well as its share of world-class con-artists, charlatans, and rakes, Farago sets out to explain just how one tiny country can be responsible for so much talent, both good and bad. Using stories from his days as a struggling writer in the bustling caf� scenes of Budapest and New York City, Farago demonstrates the Hungarian knack for remaining irrepressible and optimistic even in the face of catastrophe. Here we meet Zoltan, a fellow Bohemian who presents his astonished benefactor with a play "about nothing," a theme later made famous by another writer of Hungarian descent, Jerry Seinfeld. Farago also introduces us to "Baby Kiss," a vivacious Hungarian beauty queen, and the story of how she ended up in Fort Worth, Texas; Orkeny, a double agent for America at the height of the Cold War who "spiced up" his reports to keep everyone happy, and the author's own experience getting mustered into the supposedly non-existent Royal Hungarian Army. Farago's reminiscence validates what most Hungarians believe: that Hungary is the center of the world and that everyone has some connection to the land of the Magyars. In that spirit, Farago learns that George Washington himself was "strictly from Hungary." This edition is introduced by the author's son, who shows that the same vibrant spirit described by his father remains the hallmark of the Hungarian temperament.</p><p>Ladislas Farago (1906&#x2013;1980) a former military intelligence specialist in the is author of many acclaimed books, including <i>The Broken Seal: "Operation Magic" and the Secret Road to Pearl Harbor</i>, <i>Patton: Ordeal and Triumph</i>, and <i>The Last Days of Patton</i>, all available from Westholme.&#34;Rich in humor, confidence men, and charm.&#34;</p><h2>Heart of the Storm</h2><p>Heart of the Storm by Mary Burton released on May 31, 2005 is available now for purchase.</p><p></p><h2>Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War</h2><p>A history of the Pilgrim settlement of New England challenges popular misconceptions, discussing such topics as the diseases of European origin suffered by the Wampanoag tribe, the fragile working relationship between the Pilgrims and their Native American neighbors, and the devastating impact of the King Philip&#39;s War.

From the Big Bang to the Garden of Eden to the circumstances of our own births, we yearn to travel back to that distant time when everything was new and full of promise. Perhaps then, we tell ourselves, we can start to make sense of the convoluted mess we are in today.<p> But beginnings are rarely as clear-cut as we would like them to be. Take, for example, the event that most Americans associate with the start of the United States: the voyage of the Mayflower.</p><p> Wefve all heard at least some version of the story: how in 1620 the Pilgrims sailed to the New World in search of religious freedom; how after drawing up the Mayflower Compact, they landed at Plymouth Rock and befriended the local Wampanoags, who taught them how to plant corn and whose leader or sachem, Massasoit, helped them celebrate the First Thanksgiving. From this inspiring inception came the United States.</p><p> Like many Americans, I grew up taking this myth of national origins with a grain of salt. In their wide- brimmed hats and buckled shoes, the Pilgrims were the stuff of holiday parades and bad Victorian poetry. Nothing could be more removed from the ambiguities of modern- day America, I thought, than the Pilgrims and the Mayflower.</p><p> But, as I have since discovered, the story of the Pilgrims does not end with the First Thanksgiving. When we look to how the Pilgrims and their children maintained more than fifty years of peace with the Wampanoags and how that peace suddenly erupted into one of the deadliest wars ever fought on American soil, the history of Plymouth Colony becomes something altogether new, rich, troubling, and complex. Instead of the story we already know, it becomes the story we need to know.<br><br> In 1676, fifty-six years after the sailing of the Mayflower, a similarly named but far less famous ship, the Seaflower, departed from the shores of New England. Like the Mayflower, she carried a human cargo. But instead of 102 potential colonists, the Seaflower was bound for the Caribbean with 180 Native American slaves.</p><p> The governor of Plymouth Colony, Josiah Winslow=son of former Mayflower passengers Edward and Susanna Winslow=had provided the Seaflowerfs captain with the necessary documentation. In a certificate bearing his official seal, Winslow explained that these Native men, women, and children had joined in an uprising against the colony and were guilty of 8many notorious and execrable murders, killings, and outrages.e As a consequence, these 8heathen malefactorse had been condemned to perpetual slavery.</p><p> The Seaflower was one of several New England vessels bound for the West Indies with Native slaves. But by 1676, plantation owners in Barbados and Jamaica had little interest in slaves who had already shown a willingness to revolt. No evidence exists as to what happened to the Indians aboard the Seaflower, but we do know that the captain of one American slave ship was forced to venture all the way to Africa before he finally disposed of his cargo. And so, over a half century after the sailing of the Mayflower, a vessel from New England completed a transatlantic passage of a different sort.<br><br> The rebellion referred to by Winslow in the Seaflowerfs certificate is known today as King Philipfs War. Philip was the son of Massasoit, the Wampanoag leader who greeted the Pilgrims in 1621. Fifty-four years later, in 1675, Massasoitfs son went to war. The fragile bonds that had held the Indians and English together in the decades since the sailing of the Mayflower had been irreparably broken.</p><p> King Philipfs War lasted only fourteen months, but it changed the face of New England. After fifty-five years of peace, the lives of Native and English peoples had become so intimately intertwined that when fighting broke out, many of the regionfs Indians found themselves, in the words of a contemporary chronicler, 8in a kind of maze, not knowing what to do.e Some Indians chose to support Philip; others joined the colonial forces; still others attempted to stay out of the conflict altogether. Violence quickly spread until the entire region became a terrifying war zone. A third of the hundred or so towns in New England were burned and abandoned. There was even a proposal to build a barricade around the core settlements of Massachusetts and surrender the towns outside the perimeter to Philip and his allies.</p><p> The colonial forces ultimately triumphed, but at a horrifying cost. There were approximately seventy thousand people in New England at the outbreak of hostilities. By the end of the war, somewhere in the neighborhood of five thousand were dead, with more than three-quarters of those losses suffered by the Native Americans. In terms of percentage of population killed, King Philipfs War was more than twice as bloody as the American Civil War and at least seven times more lethal than the American Revolution. Not counted in these statistics are the hundreds of Native Americans who, like the passengers aboard the Seaflower, ended the war as slaves. It had taken fifty-six years to unfold, but one peoplefs quest for freedom had resulted in the conquest and enslavement of another.<br><br> It was Philip who led me to the Pilgrims. I was researching the history of my adopted home, Nantucket Island, when I encountered a reference to the Wampanoag leader in the townfs records. In attempting to answer the question of why Philip, whose headquarters was in modern Bristol, Rhode Island, had traveled more than sixty-five miles across the water to Nantucket, I realized that I must begin with Philipfs father, Massasoit, and the Pilgrims.</p><p> My initial impression of the period was bounded by two conflicting preconceptions: the time-honored tradition of how the Pilgrims came to symbolize all that is good about America and the now equally familiar modern tale of how the evil Europeans annihilated the innocent Native Americans. I soon learned that the real-life Indians and English of the seventeenth century were too smart, too generous, too greedy, too brave=in short, too human= to behave so predictably.</p><p> Without Massasoitfs help, the Pilgrims would never have survived the first year, and they remained steadfast supporters of the sachem to the very end. For his part, Massasoit realized almost from the start that his own fortunes were linked to those of the English. In this respect, there is a surprising amount of truth in the tired, threadbare story of the First Thanksgiving.</p><p> But the Indians and English of Plymouth Colony did not live in a static idyll of mutual support. Instead, it was fifty-five years of struggle and compromise=a dynamic, often harrowing process of give and take. As long as both sides recognized that they needed each other, there was peace. The next generation, however, came to see things differently.</p><p> When Philipfs warriors attacked in June of 1675, it was not because relentless and faceless forces had given the Indians no other choice. Those forces had existed from the very beginning. War came to New England because two leaders=Philip and his English counterpart, Josiah Winslow=allowed it to happen. For Indians and English alike, there was nothing inevitable about King Philipfs War, and the outbreak of fighting caught almost everyone by surprise.</p><p> When violence and fear grip a society, there is an almost overpowering temptation to demonize the enemy. Given the unprecedented level of suffering and death during King Philipfs War, the temptations were especially great, and it is not surprising that both Indians and English began to view their former neighbors as subhuman and evil. What is surprising is that even in the midst of one of the deadliest wars in American history, there were Englishmen who believed the Indians were not inherently malevolent and there were Indians who believed the same about the English. They were the ones whose rambunctious and intrinsically rebellious faith in humanity finally brought the war to an end, and they are the heroes of this story.<br><br> * * *<br><br> It would be left to subsequent generations of New Englanders to concoct the nostalgic and reassuring legends that have become the staple of annual Thanksgiving Day celebrations. As we shall see, the Pilgrims had more important things to worry about than who was the first to set foot on Plymouth Rock.</p><p> It is true that most of what we know about seventeenth-century New England comes from the English. In recent decades, however, archaeologists, anthropologists, and folklorists have significantly increased our understanding of the Native American culture of the time. This does not alter the fact that any account of the period must depend, for the most part, on contemporary narratives, histories, letters, documents, and poems written by English men and women.</p><p> I have focused on two people, one familiar, the other less so: Plymouth governor William Bradford and Benjamin Church, a carpenter turned Indian fighter whose maternal grandfather had sailed on the Mayflower. Bradford and Church could not have been more different=one was pious and stalwart, the other was audacious and proud=but both wrote revealingly about their lives in the New World. Together, they tell a fifty-six-year intergenerational saga of discovery, accommodation, community, and war=a pattern that was repeated time and time again as the United States worked its way west and, ultimately, out into the world.</p><p> It is a story that is at once fundamental and obscure, and it begins with a ship on a wide and blustery sea.<br> <b>PART I<br> Discovery<br><br> Chapter One<br> They Knew They Were Pilgrims</b><br><br> For sixty-five days, the Mayflower had blundered her way through storms and headwinds, her bottom a shaggy pelt of seaweed and barnacles, her leaky decks spewing salt water onto her passengersf devoted heads. There were 102 of them=104 if you counted the two dogs: a spaniel and a giant, slobbery mastiff. Most of their provisions and equipment were beneath them in the hold, the primary storage area of the vessel. The passengers were in the between, or ftween, decks=a dank, airless space about seventy-five feet long and not even five feet high that separated the hold from the upper deck. The ftween decks was more of a crawlspace than a place to live, made even more claustrophobic by the passengersf attempts to provide themselves with some privacy. A series of thin- walled cabins had been built, creating a crowded warren of rooms that overflowed with people and their possessions: chests of clothing, casks of food, chairs, pillows, rugs, and omni-present chamber pots. There was even a boat=cut into pieces for later assembly=doing temporary duty as a bed.</p><p> They were nearly ten weeks into a voyage that was supposed to have been completed during the balmy days of summer. But they had started late, and it was now November, and winter was coming on. They had long since run out of firewood, and they were reaching the slimy bottoms of their water casks. Of even greater concern, they were down to their last casks of beer. Due to the notoriously bad quality of the drinking water in seventeenth-century England, beer was considered essential to a healthy diet. And sure enough, with the rationing of their beer came the unmistakable signs of scurvy: bleeding gums, loosening teeth, and foul-smelling breath. So far only two had died=a sailor and a young servant=but if they didnft reach land soon many more would follow.</p><p> They had set sail with three pregnant mothers: Elizabeth Hopkins, Susanna White, and Mary Allerton. Elizabeth had given birth to a son, appropriately named Oceanus, and Susanna and Mary were both well along in their pregnancies.</p><p> It had been a miserable passage. In midocean, a fierce wave had exploded against the old shipfs topsides, straining a structural timber until it had cracked like a chicken bone. The Mayflowerfs master, Christopher Jones, had considered turning back to England. But Jones had to give his passengers their due. They knew next to nothing about the sea or the savage coast for which they were bound, but their resolve was unshakable. Despite all they had so far suffered=agonizing delays, seasickness, cold, and the scorn and ridicule of the sailors=they had done everything in their power to help the carpenter repair the fractured beam. They had brought a screw jack=a mechanical device used to lift heavy objects=to assist them in constructing houses in the New World. With the help of the screw jack, they lifted the beam into place, and once the carpenter had hammered in a post for support, the Mayflower was sound enough to continue on.</p><p> They were a most unusual group of colonists. Instead of noblemen, craftsmen, and servants=the types of people who had founded Jamestown in Virginia=these were, for the most part, families=men, women, and children who were willing to endure almost anything if it meant they could worship as they pleased. The motivating force behind the voyage had come from a congregation of approximately four hundred English Puritans living in Leiden, Holland. Like all Puritans, these English exiles believed that the Church of England must be purged of its many excesses and abuses. But these were Puritans with a vengeance. Instead of working for change within the established church, they had resolved to draw away from the Church of England=an illegal act in Jacobean England. Known as Separatists, they represented the radical fringe of the Puritan movement. In 1608, they had decided to do as several groups of English Separatists had done before them: emigrate to the more religiously tolerant country of Holland.</p><p> They had eventually settled in Leiden, a university town that could not have been more different from the rolling, sheep-dotted fields of their native England. Leiden was a redbrick labyrinth of building-packed streets and carefully engineered canals, a city overrun with refugees from all across Europe. Under the leadership of their charismatic minister, John Robinson, their congregation had more than tripled in size. But once again, it had become time for them to leave.</p><p> As foreigners in Holland, many of them had been forced to work menial, backbreaking jobs in the cloth industry, and their health had suffered. Despite the countryfs reputation for religious tolerance, a new and troubling era had come to Holland as a debate among the leading theologians of the day sparked civil unrest and, on occasion, violence. Just the year before, a member of their congregation had almost been killed by a rock-hurling crowd. Even worse, a Dutch treaty with Spain was about to expire, and it was feared Leiden might soon be subjected to the same kind of siege that had resulted in the deaths of half the cityfs residents during the previous century.</p><p> But their chief worry involved their children. Gradually and inevitably, they were becoming Dutch. The congregation had rejected the Church of England, but the vast majority of its members were still proudly, even defiantly, English. By sailing to the New World, they hoped to re-create the English village life they so dearly missed while remaining beyond the meddlesome reach of King James and his bishops.</p><p> It was a stunningly audacious proposition. With the exception of Jamestown, all other attempts to establish a permane...</p></p><h2>Deep Down in the Jungle: Negro Narrative Folklore from the Streets of Philadelphia</h2><p>Collected jokes, toasts, and stories from the Northern ghetto, with descriptions of the personalities and styles of the tellers</p><p>Roger D.

Wallington, <em>Man</em></p> <p> &#x201c;This is one of the most important American folklore collections yet published, and the first (excluding American Indian) to subject its materials to throughgoing psychological, sociological, and stylistic analysis.... This is a book dense with ideas and hypotheses. Abrahams concludes with a tentative theory of folklore tropisms to account for the structures, text forms, and values characteristic of Camingerley oral expression. If folklore studies have been charged with lacking theory, Abrahams has freighted his ship with the heaviest possible load it can carry and still float.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Richard M. Dorson, <em>American Anthropologist</em></p> <p> &#x201c;Abrahams&#x2019; work serves as a model for in-depth studies that could be made in other cities and towns.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Charles Blaney, <em>Negro American Literature Forum</em></p> <p> &#x201c;The dust jacket of this book tells us that in its first (1964) edition it was an &#x201c;underground classic,&#x201d; a nice way of reminding us that it went totally unreviewed the first time around but had considerable influence nonetheless. Now, in a substantially revised form, we are given a second chance.... [T]his book... is the first in many years which takes the leap from the sociology of pathos toward recognizing Afro-Americans as culture bearers and creators.... <em>Deep Down in the Jungle</em> must be required reading for all who would attempt an understanding of lower-class Afro-American life. Hopefully, the book, underground no more, will become simply a classic.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;John F. Szwed, <em>American Journal of Sociology</em></p> <p> &#x201c;Abraham&#x2019;s editorial work is carefully done, and his contention that his texts, gathered from a down-at-the-heels neighborhood in south Philadelphia, reveal a good deal about the ideas and standards of the residents is clearly supported.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;John T. Flanagan, <em>Western Folklore</em></p> <p> &#x201c;Primarily, this study pivots on a sociological perception: urban Negro society is matriarchal and the folklore the society produces and maintains is to a large extent conditioned by, and reflective of, this condition. Though mentioned by numerous social scientists, the concept of matriarchal influence is, to my knowledge, previously undeveloped in folklore studies dealing with the American Negro, perhaps because folklore and sociology have maintained for some years now a successful repulsion for one another&#x2019;s virtues and activities. The concept works, however, and its application is long overdue.... Not only is Abrahams to be commended for having produced this suggestive and informative work, but so are the University of Pennsylvania and Folklore Associates for having encouraged its production.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Bruce Jackson, <em>Journal of American Folklore</em></p> <p> &nbsp;&#x201c;A second edition of <em>Deep Down in the Jungle</em> is now available. Not only is this edition less expensive than the previous volume, but it is also a very changed book from the one Bruce Jackson reviewed in this journal six years ago.... All of these modifications are to be applauded, for they have made this work a better document on urban Negro folklore, and the book has become even more readable.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;John M.

Wisse's attempt to establish a set of criteria for a canon of Jewish literature (mainly prose fiction written by Ashkenazi Jews and their descendants in the 20th century). This is a fascinating, odd, and ambitious book, whose big ideas are ultimately less interesting than its small observations. Wisse, who is a firm believer in the moral power of fiction ("Even considering the dangers to the text that may accompany a moral education, I would argue that the importance it ascribes to words more than compensates for the occasional violence it does to them"), designates "Jewish literature" as work that "tells the stories of the Jewish people in the twentieth century ... best." <i>The Modern Jewish Canon</i> never provides a convincing, specific explanation of what exactly that means. As a result, some passages of the book (such as Wisse's ejection of Marcel Proust from her canon) seem irrationally parochial. Wisse's strongest readings concern "how the language in which Jewishness is conceived affects the nature of the literary work." She is highly sensitive to the different ways that Hebrew, Yiddish, English, Russian, and German languages give rise to distinct kinds of political, moral, religious, and literary sensibilities. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>What makes a great Jewish book? In fact, what makes a book "Jewish" in the first place? Ruth R. Wisse eloquently fields these questions in <i>The Modern Jewish Canon</i>, her compassionate, insightful guide to the finest Jewish literature of the twentieth century. From Isaac Babel to Isaac Bashevis Singer, Elie Wiesel to Cynthia Ozick, Wisse's <i>The Modern Jewish Canon</i> is a book that every student of Jewish literature, and every reader of great fiction, will enjoy.</p><h2>The Circus in Miniature: The Howard Bros.

In <i>Caravaggio's Secrets</i>, Leo Bersani and Ulysse Dutoit emphasize instead the impenetrability of these portraits. The tension between erotic invitation and self-concealing retreat leads Bersani and Dutoit to conclude that the interest of these works is in their representation of an enigmatic address that solicits intimacy in order to block it with a secret.<br> <br> Bersani and Dutoit offer a psychoanalytic reading of the enigmatic address as initiating relations grounded in paranoid fascination. They study Caravaggio's attempts to move beyond such relations, his experiments with a space no longer circumscribed by the mutual and paranoid, if erotically stimulating, fascination with imaginary secrets. In his most original work, Caravaggio proposes a radically new mode of connectedness, a nonerotic sensuality relevant to the most exciting attempts in our own time to rethink, perhaps even to reinvent, community.</p><p><i>Caravaggio's Secrets</i> begins with the painter's supposedly homoerotic work and moves from there into a discussion his art in a psychoanalytic context. One of the coauthors is a professor of French, the other, a teacher of film, and they join many other non-art historians who have offered critical commentary on Caravaggio's work. "Castration/decapitation has left David in a state of between-ness," they write of <i>David with the Head of Goliath</i> (1609-10), "not only between gendered identities but also between existential violence and what Caravaggio appears to conceive of as the aesthetic consequence of that violence.... In Goliath's head, David-Caravaggio has painted his own castration." <p> This book is probably not for general readers, but those whose interest in Caravaggio is not fully sated by some of the other, more general books on the market will likely find their fill here. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>Leo Bersani was for several years the Class of 1950 Professor of French at U.C.

Science Series)</h2><p>With illustration of the life histories of many of our butterflies by C. M. Dammers (most published for the first time) and John A. Comstock, this present book will be especially valuable to the student in understanding the biology and adaptation of the species and subspecies found in southern California. We would like to mention several specific points for the benefit of those who will be using this book: 1. In the color-plates figure caption, the data on brief locality labels have been amplified by adding the county names or other qualifying information to enable future workers to locate the geographic sources of these specimens. 2. The principle mountain ranges of southern California, commonly referred to in the text, are shown in Figure 1. 3. The Life Zone concept is used to describe distributions of butterflies largely restricted to a characteristic zone, aside from mentioning typical plant associations in each account of a butterfly species. 4. We have included authors&#39; names for all food-plants listed. Note that botanists use a slightly different system of author citations than entomologists. 5. The arrangement of species reflects our preferences and ideas regarding phylogenetic relationships. 6. Finally, it should be stated that this book incorporates the latest data available to us through March, 1973.</p><p></p><h2>ENCHANTED LOOM (Touchstone Books)</h2><p>Reveals the latest breakthroughs in astronomy, biology, and the brain sciences, relating these scientific discoveries to our new view of human beings--their place in the universe, origins, present nature, and destiny</p><p></p><h2>Dharma Flower Sutra (Lotus Sutra) Chapter 3: A Parable</h2><p>The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra, more commonly known in English as the Lotus Sutra (Sanskrit: Saddharma-pundarika-sutra), is one of the major Buddhist texts of East Asia. It was spoken in the last period of Shakyamuni Buddha s life, proclaiming the ultimate principles of the Dharma, which unites all previous teachings into one. With many parables e.g. those of the burning house, the lost son, and the rain the Buddha teaches that all beings can become fully enlightened and that this achievement, and not that of becoming Shravakas or Pratyekabuddhas, has always been the ultimate intent of his teaching. This Sutra also includes separate chapters on several important bodhisattvas within the Mahayana tradition, such as Avalokiteshvara (Guan Shi Yin) and Samantabhadra (Pu Xian). <br> There are many other translations in English of the Lotus Sutra. The uniqueness of this sixteen volume series is that all twenty-eight chapters include extensive commentary by the late Tripitaka Master Hsuan Hua, whose accessible explanations show this ancient text s meaning as instruction for practice on the spiritual path in the modern world. <br> The English translation of this Sutra and the commentary of Master Hua was done by the Buddhist Text Translation Society (BTTS). The translation process of the Society is modeled after the translation assemblies of earlier times and publishes work only after it has passed through four committees for primary translation, revision, editing, and certification. The leaders of these committees are bhikshus (monks) and bhikshunis (nuns) who have devoted their lives to the study and practice of the Buddha s teachings. For that reason, works published by the Society emphasize the practical applications of the Buddha s teachings. <br> Volume 4 in this series is a translation of Chapter 3: A Parable, where the Buddha uses the analogy of an elder saving his children from a burning house to explain how he saves living beings. <br> Other books in the series include <br> Vol 1 Introduction by Tripitaka Master Hsuan Hua, ISBN: 0-88139-433-5 (2001, 2nd edition). <br> Vol. 2 Ch 1: Introduction, ISBN 0-917512-22-7 (1977). <br> Vol. 3 - Ch 2: Expedient Devices, ISBN 0-917512-26-X (1979). <br> Vol. 5 Ch 4: Belief and Understanding, ISBN 0-917512-64-2 (1980). <br> Vol. 6 Ch 5: Medicinal Herbs, Ch 6: Conferring Predictions, ISBN 0-917512-65-0 (1980). <br> Vol. 7 Ch 7: The Analogy of the Transformation City, ISBN 0-917512-67-7 (1980). <br> Vol. 8 Ch 8: Five Hundred Disciples Receive Predictions, Ch 9: Bestowing Predictions, ISBN 0-917512-71-5 (1980). <br> Vol. 9 Ch 10:Masters of the Dharma, Ch 11: Vision of the Jeweled Stupa, ISBN 0-917512-85-5 (1981). <br> Vol. 10 Ch 12: Devedatta, Ch 13:Exhortation to Maintain, ISBN 0-917512-34-0 (1982). <br> Vol 11 Ch 14 Happily Dwelling Conduct, ISBN: 978-0-88139-443-6. <br> Vol 12 Ch 15 Welling Forth from the Earth, Ch 16 Thus Come One s Life Span, ISBN: 978-0-88139-443-6. <br> Vol 13 Ch 17: Discrimination of Merit and Virtue, Ch 18: Rejoicing in Accord with Merit and Virtue, Ch 19 The Merit and Virtue of a Dharma Master, ISBN 978-0-88139-445-0. <br> Vol 14 Ch 20 Never-Slighting Bodhisattva, Ch 21 The Spiritual Powers of the Thus Come One, Ch 22 The Entrustment, Ch 23 Medicine King Bodhisattva, Ch 24 Bodhisattva Wondrous Sound, ISBN 978-0-88139-446-7. <br> Vol 15- Ch 25 Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, ISBN 978-0-88139-447-4. <br> Vol 16- Ch 26 Dharani, Ch 27 King Wonderful Adorment, Ch 28 Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, ISBN 978-0-88139-448-1. <br> Chinese version: Miao Fa Lian Hua Jing, ISBN: 0-88139-429-7, text only with pinyin for chanting. <br> Miaofa Lianhua Jing Qianshi: ISBN: 978-986732-839-7, 10 volumes Chinese text with explanation</p><p>Tripitaka Master Hsuan Hua (1918-1995) was a monastic reformer and the first Chinese master to teach Buddhism to large numbers of Westerners. During his long career he supported the translation of the Buddhist canon into English and other languages. Born in 1918 to a peasant family in a small village south of Harbin, in northeast China, Master Hua was the youngest of eight children. After his mother s death, when he was 19, he became a monk and meditated by his mother s grave for three years and practiced other austerities. He received full ordination in 1947 at the Buddhist holy mountain Pu Tuo. At Nan Hua Monastery, the Bodhimanda of the Sixth Patriarch, in Guang Dong Province, he received from Chan Master Xu Yun (1840-1959) the Dharma-seal as the 9th Patriarch of the Wei Yang lineage, the 46th generation in a line descending from Shakyamuni Buddha. Master Xu Yun also bestowed upon him the Dharma-transmission name Hs�an Hua. In 1949, Master Hua left China for Hong Kong, where he taught meditation, lectured on the Buddhist sutras, and helped to establish three Buddhist monasteries. In 1962, he traveled to the United States at the invitation of his Hong Kong disciples, who were then living in San Francisco Bay Area, and he began lecturing at the San Francisco Buddhist Lecture Hall. In 1970, Master Hua moved from Chinatown to the newly established Gold Mountain Monastery in the Mission District of San Francisco. In 1976 he established a new headquarters at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, in Ukiah, California. Additionally, he founded the Buddhist Text Translation Society with the goal of translating the Buddhist canon. It has now published over two hundred volumes of translations. Before his passing at the age of 77 near Los Angeles, he had founded over 20 monasteries and temples worldwide.</p><h2>How Do Dinosaurs Go Up and Down?: A Book of Opposites</h2><p>A novelty book of OPPOSITES from the bestselling HOW DO DINOSAURS series!With inventive gatefold flaps on every spread, these classic, bestselling characters from Jane Yolen and Mark Teague are a perfect introduction to basic opposites.Young readers will love to flip through the gatefold flaps and read this uproarious book again and again!Book Details:Format: HardcoverPublication Date: 7/1/2011Pages: 14Reading Level: Age 2 and Up</p><p>Jane Yolen is the beloved author of more than four hundred books for children and adults, including award-winning picture books, fiction, and poetry.

Islam continues to be for many a mysterious and misunderstood force, alien to our own cultural values. <p>Yet, in more ways than expected, Christianity and Islam share common ground. For centuries, Sufi thinkers have been linked to both religions in certain important ideas. </p><p>But, like the elephant in the dark in Jalaludin Rumi's classic fable, these ideas are not grasped in full by seizing parts of the whole and arguing for or against their supposed Christian or Islamic derivation. </p><p>From a series of lectures given by Idries Shah as a Visiting Professor at Geneva University, Switzerland, The Elephant in the Dark shifts focus to more fruitful ground, tracing documented episodes of co-operation and understanding between Christians and Moslems over the past 1,400 years</p></p><p>As the urgency of our global situation becomes apparent, more and more readers are turning to the books of Idries Shah (1924-1996) as a way to train new capacities and new ways of thinking. Shah has been described as "the most significant worker adapting classical spiritual thought to the modern world." <p>Shah was educated in both the East and West, by private tutors and through wide-ranging travel and personal encounters - the series of journeys which characterize Sufi education and development. In keeping with Sufi tradition, his life was essentially one of service. His knowledge and interests appeared limitless, and his activities and accomplishments took place in many different countries and in numerous fields of endeavor. </p><p>Shah was Director of Studies of the Institute for Cultural Research, an educational organization sponsoring interdisciplinary and crosscultural studies of human thought; a founding member of the Club of Rome; a Governor of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables; and the founder of publishing house Octagon Press. </p><p>Shah's landmark book, "The Sufis", invited readers to approach Sufi ideas and test them out. The evident and common sense made it clear that here was a sane, authoritative voice in the wilderness of the gobbledegookish mysticism of the sixties. The lively, contemporary books on traditional psychologies, literature, philosophy and Sufi thought that followed established a broad historical and cultural context for Sufi thought and action. These have so far sold over 15 million copies in 12 languages worldwide and have been awarded many prizes. They have been reviewed by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Times, The Tribune, The Telegraph, and numerous other international journals and newspapers. </p><p>University and college courses throughout the world are employing Shah's books, or works based on them, in a wide variety of disciplines including sociology, psychology and literature. </p><p>In 1969, Idries Shah was awarded the Dictionary of International Biography's Certificate of Merit for Distinguished Service to Human Thought. Other honors included a Two Thousand Men of Achievement award (1971), Six First Prizes awarded by the UNESCO International Book Year (1972), and the International Who's Who in Poetry's Gold Medal for Poetry (1975). </p><p>According to his obituary in the London Daily Telegraph "it is impossible to assess his influence, and his legacy is incalculable". </p><p>He was, it is said, the Sufi Teacher of the Age. </p><p>"The most interesting books in the English language." Saturday Review </p><p>"A major psychological and cultural event of our time." Psychology Today </p><p>"One is immediately forced to use one's mind in a new way." New York Times </p><p>The instrumental function of Shah's work is now well established among people from all walks of life. Stockbrokers, scientists, lawyers, managers, writers, physicians, and diplomats have found Shah's literature for human development "extraordinary". </p><p>"It presents a blueprint of the human mental structure." Robert Ornstein, Ph.D. </p><p>"Extremely useful in teaching students about management and computers." Thomas Malone, MIT </p><p>"Idries Shah provides the unique perspective that allows us to assess real motivations and social biases in a more accurate light." E. Neilsen, Attorney at Law</p>PREFACE Christian scholars often say that Sufi theories are close to those of Christianity. Many Moslems maintain that they are essentially derived from Islam. The resemblance of many Sufi ideas to those of several religious and esoteric systems are sometimes taken as evidence of derivation. The Islamic interpretation is that religion is of one origin, differences being due to local or historical causes. <p>Rumi, the Sufi teacher of 700 years ago, has emphasised and strikingly illustrated the last contention in his tale of the men who sought to examine an elephant by the sense of touch alone. Each thought that one part was the whole, and experienced it, moreover, in a manner slightly different from reality. The elephant was only, for one a fan (an ear), for another a rope (the tail), for a third a pillar (a leg) and so on. </p><p>These lectures provide material for the consideration of common factors, in theory and in development, from the viewpoint of the idea of surrender to the Divine Will, reviewing some aspects of the interplay between Christians and Moslems, and introducing material from and about Sufis. </p><p>Copyright � 1974, 1978, 1982 Idries Shah.

After the war, he converts to Catholicism, becomes a priest, enters the Order of Barefoot Carmelites and emigrates to Israel. Despite this seeming impossibility, the life and destiny of Daniel Stein are not an invention, the character is based on the life of Oswald Rufeisen, the real Brother Daniel, a Carmelite monk. In Daniel Stein, Interpreter, Daniel s ability and willingness to communicate with all cultures, to translate across linguistic and cultural divides, assures his freedom and stands as a symbol of love, humanity and tolerance.</p><p>Ludmila Ulitskaya was born in the Urals. Shortly before perestroika she became Repertory Director of the Hebrew Theatre of Moscow. She is the author of fourteen fiction books, three children&#39;s books and six plays. She is Russia&#39;s bestselling novelist.In her fourth book to be translated into English (for which Tait won the PEN Literature in Translation award), Ulitskaya weaves a dense narrative of the lives touched by Br. Daniel Stein. Ulitskaya's (The Funeral Party) ambitious effort is a kind of case file composed of conversations, lectures, sermons, and excerpts from letters, diaries, and news articles. The story begins in 1942 in Belorussia, where Stein, a clandestine Polish Jew pressed into service by the Germans, secretly helps 300 Jews escape the ghetto. After the war he converts to Catholicism, becomes a priest, and moves to Israel, where he influences the lives of many over a number of years. With warmth and intelligence, Stein addresses life's great challenges and the complexities of faith, though not everyone is pleased with his unorthodox views. Ulitskaya's story of one man's devotion to bridging the divide between Christianity and Judaism in the Holy Land raises complex theological, moral, and emotional questions. Sympathetic characters (many drawn from real life) and a layered structure allows the tension of these myriad lives to emerge naturally. (Apr.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Ben Witherington first tells how and why the New Testament documents were written and collected and how they came to be known as the New Testament that we have today. He then discusses the main stories and major figures in the New Testament. Witherington looks particularly at the Gospels, examining how and why their stories differ and pointing out what these ancient biographies actually say about Jesus. He also surveys the ways that these stories were told and retold, explaining how this literary development has influenced Christian theology, ethics, and social thought. At once scholarly and accessible - it really is written in plain English - Witherington&#39;s guide to the origins and message of the New Testament is eminently suitable as a text for college and seminary students. With each chapter followed by a section called &#34;Exercises and Questions for Study and Reflection,&#34; The New Testament Story will also prove valuable to individual readers and ideal for church classes and group Bible studies.</p><p>Ben Witherington III is professor of New Testament at Asbury Theological Seminary, Wilmore, Kentucky.Witherington (<i>The Brother of Jesus</i>), a professor at Asbury Theological Seminary, teams up with Asbury student Hyatt to introduce the New Testament to laypeople without sucking the life out of it, covering origin, plot and main characters. The first section is a thorough, lively discourse on the cultural background of the writing and compiling of the Testament. The second section delivers insights on entire books and individual passages, from the grand themes of Paul to the similarities among various episodes in the life of Peter. Readers used to taking scripture a few verses at a time may find that such observations inspire new appreciation for the New Testament as a whole. But lay readers might trip on the stumbling block of the book's scholarly bent; discussions of academic issues&#x2014;such as the literary relationship among Matthew, Mark and Luke, or John's indebtedness to Wisdom literature&#x2014;risk losing all but the most dedicated. Conservative evangelical readers should also know that the book casts doubt on Peter's authorship of 1 Peter and Paul's writing of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus. Nevertheless, the depth and big-picture perspective of Witherington's work will succeed in bringing serious Bible students a fresh appreciation for the New Testament story. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Richter must also lead the way through a series of unexpected turns that eventually uncovers a mole high up within the government who is in pursuit of his own personal revenge.</p><p>If Richter fails, it won't be just the lives of his team that are lost, but America itself.</p></p><p><p>Former U.S. Air Force captain Dale Brown is the superstar author of 26 best-selling action-adventure &#x201c;techno-thriller&#x201d; novels: FLIGHT OF THE OLD DOG (1987), SILVER TOWER (1988), DAY OF THE CHEETAH (1989), HAMMERHEADS (1990), SKY MASTERS (1991), NIGHT OF THE HAWK (1992), CHAINS OF COMMAND (1993), STORMING HEAVEN (1994), SHADOWS OF STEEL (1996), FATAL TERRAIN (1997), THE TIN MAN (1998), BATTLE BORN, (1999), WARRIOR CLASS (2001), WINGS OF FIRE (2002), AIR BATTLE FORCE (2003), PLAN OF ATTACK (2004), ACT OF WAR (2005), EDGE OF BATTLE (2006), STRIKE FORCE (2007), SHADOW COMMAND (2008), ROGUE FORCES (2009), EXECUTIVE INTENT (2010), A TIME FOR PATRIOTS (2011), TIGER&#x2019;S CLAW (2012), STARFIRE (2014), and IRON WOLF (2015).

He's as American as all get out as good guy Jason Richards, the only decent person in this espionage story, which pits the evil American government against the evil polluter that is fighting evil environmentalists who use dirty nukes to make their point. All the while, innocent Americans are mere pawns and cannon fodder. The energetic Pressman excels at distinguishing one villain from another. It's not his fault that the premise of the story--soldiers using robot suits to fight terrorists--just doesn't cut it.

She walks through a red poppy field, hops under an orange bridge, waddles around a yellow cornfield, rushes past a big green tree, and paddles across a deep blue pond. By the time she reaches her nest, purple clouds have begun to rain, but don&#x2019;t worry &#x2014; the book&#x2019;s rounded pages, each one smaller than the last, form a spectacular rainbow on the last spread! With the boldest of colors and enchantingly simple shapes, Frances Barry&#x2019;s collage illustrations combine with an ingenious format for an eye-popping concept-book debut.</p><p>Frances Barry says the idea for DUCKIE'S RAINBOW came to her "on the top deck of a London bus. Not that I saw a rainbow, but I&#x2019;ve always found it a great place to brainstorm with a sketchbook! I named the character Duckie because it was a term of endearment my great-aunt used for everyone." Frances Barry has worked as a designer of greeting cards and stationery and has painted several public and private murals. This is her first book.PreS&#x2013;Duckie is hurrying home to her nest. On the way she encounters a field of red poppies, an orange bridge, yellow corn, and more. This deceptively simple, fan-shaped concept book is wonderfully creative. Each spread adds its color to an arc at the top of the page; at the end, Duckie sees a beautiful rainbow. The pages are graduated so that when opened the book is a half-circle showing the rings of color. The collage art is basic and the hues are bright. Duckie will appeal to preschoolers, especially toddlers, and be a great addition to storytimes.<i>&#x2013;Elaine Lesh Morgan, Multnomah County Library, Portland, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While these large-format color photographs are made all over the world, they aren&#39;t about any particular place or population. By a process of intimate and often extended engagement, Soth&#39;s portraits and images of his subject&#39;s surroundings involve an enquiry into the extent to which a photographic likeness can depict more than the outer surface of an individual, and perhaps even plumb the depths of something unknowable about both the sitter and the photographer. &#34;After the publication of my last book about social life in America, Songbook, and a retrospective of my four, large scale American projects, Gathered Leaves, I went through a long period of rethinking my creative process. For over a year I stopped traveling and photographing people. I barely took any pictures at all. When I returned to photography, I wanted to strip the medium down to its primary elements. Rather than trying to make some sort of epic narrative about America, I wanted to simply spend time looking at other people and, hopefully, briefly glimpse their interior life. In order to try and access these lives, I made all of the photographs in interior spaces. While these rooms often exist in far-flung places, it&#39;s only to emphasize that these pictures aren&#39;t about any place in particular. Whether a picture is made in Odessa or Minneapolis, my goal was the same: to simply spend time in the presence of another beating heart.&#34; - Alec Soth.</p><p></p><h2>Rather Die Fighting</h2><p>A personal account of a young Jewish-Polish resistance fighter describes his witness to the ways in which the arrival of the Nazis turned his formerly peaceful neighbors against one another, in a memoir that describes how he escaped the Nazis and helped to form an underground fighting platoon of all-Jewish soldiers.</p><p>Frank Blaichman married a fellow partisan after the war, and in the 1950s they emigrated to the United States.

It aims to support new and existing elders and overseers in this vital role.</p><p></p><h2>Through the Safety Net</h2><p>Portrays a gallery of middle-class Americans who share upward-bound aspirations and a fear of falling, as they face the defining moments of their lifes</p><p>Read one paragraph of a Charles Baxter story, and you know you're in the hands of a master. Consider, for example, the opening line of "Winter Journey": "Harrelson, perpetual Ph.D. student, poverty-stricken dissertation nonfinisher, academic man of all work, gourmand, stands in the tiny kitchen cluttered with yellow note pads, a basketball, books, misplaced bookmarks, and boxes of ant killer, staring down at a dented saucepan of cold soup." In a single sentence, Baxter has limned a whole life. The story that follows of Harrelson's drunken drive through the snow to rescue a fianc�e who no longer wants him simply fills in the contours. Baxter specializes in ordinary lives--each story is an accretion of details, some funny, some disturbing, that create a complete world. The events that happen in this world are equally ordinary--people make love, make dinner, make decisions they may or may not carry out--but just when you think you know where things are going, Baxter throws in a gentle curve that sends you right off the road. <p> The title story, for example, takes the reader through a day in the life of Dinah Nadler, a dentist, wife, and mother whose regular consultations with a psychic take a dark turn. His warning that there's a "black spot ... blinking, at the horizon" of her life freights even the most commonplace actions with dread. Baxter only hints at what might be happening in Dinah's life, but he does it so well that the ambiguity of his mild-seeming conclusion, "Then she went back to the window, cupped her hands on both sides of her face, and looked outside to see what was happening," is truly chilling. Each of the 11 stories in this collection demonstrates Baxter's quirky, chiaroscuro view of the universe, and also stands as testimony to the fact that he is one of the best fiction writers at work today. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Baxter dives into the undercurrents of middle-class American life in these eleven arresting, often mesmerizing stories. Whether they know it or not, Baxter's characters are floating above an abyss of unruly desire, inexplicable dread, unforeseen tragedy, and sudden moments of grace. <br>A drunken graduate student hurtles cheerfully through a snowstorm to rescue a fiancee who no longer wants him. A hospital maintenance worker makes a perverse bid for his place in the sunlight of celebrity. A man and a woman who have lost their only child cling fiercely to the one thing they have left of her--their grief. Lit by the quiet lightning of Baxter's prose, Through the Safety Net is filled with rare artistry and feeling.</p><h2>The Kitten&#39;s Tale (Pet Vet)</h2><p>Book by Odgers, Darrel, Odgers, Sally</p><p></p><h2>Argentine Deadline Phoenix Force #1 An Executioner Series</h2><p>Argentine Deadline by Don Pendleton released on Apr 23, 1982 is available now for purchase.</p><p></p><h2>Granta 87: Jublilee (Granta: The Magazine of New Writing)</h2><p>A celebration of Granta&#39;s first quarter century with new writing from the writers who made its reputation, including Martin Amis, Paul Auster, William Boyd, Amit Chaudhul, Richard Ford, James Hamilton-Paterson, Jan Morris, Blake Morrison, Jayne Anne Phillips, Paul Theroux and Edmund White.</p><p></p><h2>Refocusing My Family: Coming Out, Being Cast Out, and Discovering the True Love of God</h2><p><p>In 2012, at the age of twenty-seven, Amber Cantorna came out to her family as gay.

Smart, spirited, and instinctively compassionate, Pransky turned out to be not only a terrific therapist but an unerring moral compass.

She has been a Rhodes Scholar and a Guggenheim Fellow and is a scholar in residence at Middlebury College. She lives with her husband, the writer Bill McKibben, and Pransky in Ripton, Vermont.Introduction<br><br>Pransky, my soon-to-be ten-year-old dog, is lying<br>on the living room couch, her body filling it end to<br>end, for though she is not a big dog, she is double-<br>jointed, which means that her hips lay out flat. If I weren&#x2019;t<br>typing this I&#x2019;d be stretched out next to her because I&#x2019;m<br>tired, too, as I often am on Tuesday afternoons. Every<br>other day of the week, Pransky is a carefree country dog<br>who operates by instinct, roaming the meadow around<br>our house. But Tuesday mornings we spend time at the<br>county nursing home, going door-to-door dispensing<br>canine companionship and good cheer. Working at the<br>nursing home requires us to pay attention&#x2014;Pransky to<br>me, to her surroundings, and to the people she is<br>meeting, and me to her, to our surroundings, and to the people<br>we are meeting. After three years you&#x2019;d think we<br>would have gotten tougher or more robust, but that&#x2019;s<br>never happened and probably never will.<br><br>When I first considered training Pransky to be a therapy dog<br>she was in her late adolescence. Dog years being<br>what they are, she is now about the same age as most of<br>the people in the nursing home. Even so, the words<br>&#x201c;work&#x201d; and &#x201c;walk&#x201d; still get her to her feet in a unit of<br>time that is less than a second. Is she better at her job,<br>more empathetic, now that she, too, is of a certain age? I<br>doubt it. I doubt it because I don&#x2019;t think she could be<br>more empathetic.<br><br>As foreign as the nursing home environment was to<br>both of us when we first started visiting County, it was<br>a little less so to me, since my first job was at a medical<br>school in a teaching hospital where I sometimes<br>went on rounds. I was in my late twenties, with a newly<br>minted doctorate, hired to teach ethics to second-year<br>students. This should tell you all you need to know about<br>how seriously that place took the ethical part of medical<br>education: at that age I had about as much experience<br>with the complicated ethical dilemmas of sick people<br>and their families as the second-years in my class had<br>treating sick people and dealing with those ethical dilemmas,<br>which is to say, basically, none. Still, reality<br>was not our mandate. We were supposed to consider<br>what might happen &#x201c;if,&#x201d; and then think through the best<br>&#x201c;then.&#x201d;<br><br>The one thing you need to know about modern<br>philosophy is that the operative word in the previous<br>sentence is &#x201c;best.&#x201d; The first thing we had to do in that class<br>was figure out what it meant. Was it what the person in the<br>bed said she wanted, what the doctor wanted, what the<br>hospital&#x2019;s risk manager wanted, what the church<br>(whatever church it was) wanted, what the husband wanted,<br>what the other doctor wanted, what the wife wanted,<br>what the parents wanted, what the partner wanted, what<br>the children wanted? Sorting out what was best was, to<br>say the least, challenging. For guidance, we read works by<br>Kant and Aristotle and Bentham that were harder to get<br>through than the textbooks on human anatomy and<br>organic chemistry, and, for my students, who were itching<br>to get into the clinic, largely beside the point. While I<br>didn&#x2019;t think for a minute that an abstract principle, like<br>Kant&#x2019;s categorical imperative, say, was actually going to<br>lead to the right decision on whether or not to give a new<br>heart to a homeless man, it seemed like a reasonable idea,<br>in a place where right answers were often not as black-<br>and-white as they might appear, to inject some of these<br>notions into the future doctors&#x2019; heads. If ideas like these<br>could become part of their mental landscape, then in the<br>future, confronted with that homeless man, they might<br>see the terrain with greater definition.<br><br>Historically, when people looked for guidance on how<br>to conduct their lives, they turned to philosophy or religion or both.<br>That&#x2019;s less true now, as formal religious<br>affiliations drop away and academic philosophy becomes<br>more and more arcane. It&#x2019;s not that people are less inclined<br>to examine their lives or to seek wisdom, it&#x2019;s just that they<br>are more likely to look for it in other places: in support<br>groups, on radio call-in shows, from life coaches, on the<br>Internet, in books, or, in my case, inadvertently, with my<br>dog, in a nursing home.<br><br>When Pransky and I started working at County, I<br>expected to learn things&#x2014;how could I not?&#x2014;though<br>what those things would be I had no clue. I assumed I&#x2019;d<br>learn something about old people, and about the thera-<br>peutic value of animals in a medical setting, and about<br>myself in that setting, which was alien and not a little<br>scary. What I found myself learning quickly sorted itself<br>into a template that anyone with a Catholic education,<br>especially&#x2014;which would not include me&#x2014;would<br>recognize as the seven virtues: love, hope, faith, prudence,<br>justice, fortitude, restraint.<br><br>It should be said that the Catholics didn&#x2019;t have a corner<br>on virtue, in general, or on these seven in particular;<br>they just happened to enumerate and, in a sense, popularize<br>them, so when we think of virtue, we tend to think in<br>sevens. But well before Catholic theologians codified their<br>list, Greek philosophers, most notably Plato and Aristotle,<br>offered advice as to the traits and behaviors that should<br>be cultivated in order to live a good, productive, meaningful<br>life, a life with and for others. It was to Plato&#x2019;s original four&#x2014;<br>courage, wisdom, justice, and restraint&#x2014;that, centuries later,<br>Saint Augustine added love, hope, and faith&#x2014;what are commonly<br>called &#x201c;the theological virtues.&#x201d; These, he believed, both came from<br>God and delivered one to God and, ultimately, to a place in heaven. In<br>our own time, for most people, love and hope and even<br>faith, if you think of it as loyalty and consistency, are<br>unmoored from visions of an afterlife. Still, the virtues<br>remain as guides not only to good conduct but to our<br>better&#x2014;and possibly happier, more harmonious, most<br>humane&#x2014;selves.<br><br>Happiness, as it happened, was the dominant emotion<br>for both Pransky and me when we were at the nursing<br>home, strange as that sounds, and strange as it was. I<br>didn&#x2019;t go there to be happy any more than I did to learn<br>about hope or fortitude, or to think about courage and<br>faith, but that&#x2019;s what happened. You could say I was lucky,<br>and, in fact, by landing at County, I was lucky. County<br>happens to be blessed with tremendous leadership, a devoted<br>staff, and a larger community that embraces rather than<br>isolates it. I wouldn&#x2019;t presume that it is comparable to any<br>other nursing home. But I do believe that in settings like<br>nursing homes, as well as hospitals and hospices and any<br>other place where life is in the balance, we get to essentials,<br>which is what the virtues are.<br><br>More than luck was at work, too. My dog was at work,<br>and she brought to it a lightness and easiness that seemed<br>to expand outward and encompass almost everyone she<br>encountered. We often talk about &#x201c;getting out of our<br>comfort zone,&#x201d; but rarely about entering someone else&#x2019;s.<br>Pransky made that possible. With her by my side, and<br>sometimes in the lead, I was able to be a better, more<br>responsive, less reticent version of myself. One day a man<br>I didn&#x2019;t know was sitting idly by himself in the nursing<br>home hall. He was wearing a badly tied hospital johnny<br>that exposed part of his back, and nothing else. It was<br>rare for people at County not to be dressed in street<br>clothes, but it wasn&#x2019;t his attire that caught my attention.<br>The man was jaundiced and almost as yellow as the liquid<br>running through the tube that started under his hospital<br>gown and ended in a bag on the side of his wheelchair.<br>That, and he had no legs. This was not Joe, another double<br>amputee who became one of our regulars and will<br>appear in these pages, but someone I&#x2019;d never seen before<br>and never saw again. If I had been alone, I might have<br>nodded in his direction and kept going, because that man<br>represented most of the things that scared me about nursing<br>homes: debilitating illness, a lack of privacy, bodily<br>fluids. But I was not alone, and my partner veered in his<br>direction, which meant that I had no choice but to go<br>over and talk to him. What a nice guy! We talked dogs<br>(he had two Yorkies at home), sports (he was a Steelers<br>fan), and dogs some more. I was in his comfort zone,<br>and Pransky&#x2019;s, and then, ultimately, mine. It was, in the<br>scheme of things, a small thing, but small things add up.<br><br>My mommy would like your doggie,&#x201d; a youngish<br>woman with developmental disabilities said to me<br>the first time we met her at County.<br><br>&#x201c;My doggie would like your mommy,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Where<br>does she live?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In heaven,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Pransky has a lot of friends in heaven.&#x201d;<br>And after what was by then a year at County, it was true.<br><br>A certain amount of death is inevitable in a nursing<br>home. This is where the virtues can be helpful. They<br>point us at what&#x2019;s important and valuable in life. They<br>can offer perspective and frames of reference, and if a<br>dog is in the frame, all the better.<br><br>As I was working on this book, and friends asked me<br>what it was about, I would say &#x201c;right living and<br>dogs&#x201d; or &#x201c;moral philosophy and dogs&#x201d; or &#x201c;old people and<br>dogs.&#x201d; Eventually I realized that every one of those<br>descriptions was wrong. I was saying &#x201c;dogs,&#x201d; plural,<br>when it was actually about one singular, faithful, charitable,<br>loving, and sometimes prudent dog. That dog has<br>risen from her slumber and is standing behind me now,<br>showing great hope, restraint, and fortitude as she waits<br>for me to stop typing and go for a walk.</p><h2>A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy</h2><p>No issue is more hotly debated than how, or even if, a politician's private life affects his public competence. In <b><i>A Question of Character</i></b> John F. Kennedy's two lives&#x2014;public and private&#x2014;are examined to answer this timely question. Respected historian and biographer Thomas C. Reeves reveals discrepancies between JFK's public persona, which has reached mythic proportions, and his scandalous private behavior. Most illuminating is the constant theme or Joe Kennedy's almost total control of JFK's behavior and politics throughout most of his son's career. <br><br> "The John Kennedy who emerges from these pages was not a man of good moral character.

Alexander Bonnyman, Jr. was mortally wounded while leading a successful assault on a critical Japanese fortification on the Pacific atoll of Tarawa, and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military honor. The brutal, bloody 76-hour battle would ultimately claim the lives of more than 1,100 Marines and 5,000 Japanese forces. <br> But Bonnyman's remains, along with those of hundreds of other Marines, were hastily buried and lost to history following the battle, and it would take an extraordinary effort by a determined group of dedicated civilians to find him. <br> In 2010, having become disillusioned with the U.S. government's half-hearted efforts to recover the "lost Marines of Tarawa," Bonnyman's grandson, Clay Bonnyman Evans, was privileged to join the efforts of History Flight, Inc., a non-governmental organization dedicated to finding and repatriating the remains of lost U.S. service personnel.

As a young man he was banished from polite society as a result of a homosexual scandal, but remained a close friend of Stendhal and Balzac and was admired by Baudelaire for his dandyism. In 1835, when de Tocqueville&#39;s &#34;Democracy in America&#34; became a bestseller, Balzac suggested that Custine should do for European perceptions of Russia what de Tocqueville had done for America. Custine went to Russia a monarchist and legitimist, but returned a constitutionalist.

Most of the poems mark a return to what may be his least interesting style?a heavily Dada-influenced avant-garde poetics best seen in his 1983 That Dada Strain. A section of "Improvisations" seems forced and mannered ("Look, the girl in white cries out, the sun has grown a moustache"). Another section, "An Oracle for Delfi," doesn't quite achieve its self-proclaimed "classical" goal, "to make a poem of seedings/ like poems &amp; photographs of hands/ all of us share." Rothenberg is far more successful in "Seedings," the long opening poem on life and death. Its plain style displays the influence of the primitive oral and tribal poetics that have been the focus of much of his recent work ("...it is better that the dead/ stay dead their confusion would only alarm us/ who remain alive &amp; sometimes have to think/ about the dead &amp; what to say to them/ to set things straight"). The closing section, "14 Stations"?written to accompany a series of drawings of Nazi concentration camps?is a powerful and sad meditation on the Holocaust, the subject of his 1989 collection, Khurbn &amp; Other Poems. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Rothenberg (Poems for the Millennium, LJ 10/1/95), perhaps the finest American visionary poet alive, finds the perfect vehicle as he sets his sights on the approaching millennium. The "seedings" of the title are not only the seeds of new life but "the seeds of war." And a few pages later: "I write this in a dream passage between worlds.../ Now is the time to make your peace with earth/ now is the time to overcome forgetting." Visions aside, this collection extends other aspects of his 40-year career. In brief, hard-hitting, single-image poems recalling his earlier "Sightings," he takes heart by examining and offering up the skewed imagery of gods, saints, and martyrs that artists have depicted. Recalling Vienna Blood (New Directions, 1980), this volume closes with a memorable sequence based on 14 railroad "stations" of the Holocaust. Here he relies upon chance numerology as both a distancing and a drawing closer, but, unlike chance sequences by other writers, these poems are honed to perfection.?Rochelle Ratner, formerly Poetry Editor, "Soho Weekly News," New York<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Complete Needlepoint Course</h2><p>Describes basic materials and techniques, offers a stitch glossary, and provides instructions for projects featuring tent, bargello, and pulled thread stitches</p><p>Needlework encompasses far more than the traditional tent stitch and cross-stitch variations.

Page after page of lavish full-color illustrations and black-and-whites from one of America's best-loved children's artists adorn this hefty volume. Sendak, best known for the charming and timeless <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>, never fails to amuse and astonish with his creative wizardry. He was talented from the cradle, and his early works from the 1940s are given due recognition here--reflecting his fascination with the small intricacies of being human, and his devilish sense of humor. Even a stuffy physics textbook from 1947 is given the Sendak touch, as atoms, molecules, and chain reactions take on the form of people jiving and swinging. Always the artistic adventurer, Sendak experiments with many different forms--from the fairy-tale-like pen-and-ink drawings of <i>Higglety Pigglety Pop!</i> to the beautiful watercolor pieces that illustrate <i>Mr. Rabbit and the Lovely Present</i>. Virtually every page contains another Sendak gem--be it a quick sketch, an exquisite portrait of his mother or sister, or the preliminary drawings from <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>. Three huge fold-outs make for an extra-special treat.<p> The book's rich text is exemplary--based on interviews, conversations, and extensive research by Sendak's close friend Selma Lanes. The author invites us into the very special world of Maurice Sendak, a place of fantasies and wonderment, a land where adults can be children--and never grow up. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p></p><h2>Mrs. Kennedy: The Missing History of the Kennedy Years</h2><p>A definitive portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy during the thousand days of John F. Kennedy&#39;s administration sheds new light on her life as both a woman and as First Lady, drawing on eyewitness testimony, intimate letters, and previously unavailable documents to document the tumultuous everyday world of a woman fighting for herself, her marriage, and her husband&#39;s presidency. 100,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Barbara Leaming</b> is the author of several books, including the critically acclaimed <i>Orson Welles,</i> written with Welles's cooperation, as well as the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Katharine Hepburn.</i> A graduate of Smith College in Russian Studies, she also earned a Ph.D. at New York University and taught for many years at Hunter College in New York City. Her articles have appeared in <i>Vanity Fair</i> and the <i>New York Times Magazine.</i> She lives in Connecticut.<b>Author's Note</b><p>Had it not been for the fact that Jacqueline Kennedy was married to the President of the United States, it is unlikely that a single book about her would have been written. And yet, in the dozens of books about her, specific details of that presidency have been largely excluded. Even more striking, and of greater consequence, is the fact that the histories of John F. Kennedy's presidency are comparably flawed, missing as they do the story of Jacqueline Kennedy and her crucial role. In an effort to fill the gap, I have tried to tell her story in those years with as much attention to the presidency as to the events of her private life. The role of Jacqueline Kennedy is probably less understood than any other part of the Kennedy presidency; equally, her personal story cannot be grasped without seeing it in the context of the unfolding events of one of the twentieth century's most dramatic presidencies. Her life was changed by historical events in ways she had never anticipated. She, in turn, influenced certain of those events in ways that until now have remained largely unexamined.</p><p>The chronicle of any presidency is incomplete without a consideration of the president's private life. That is even more true in the case of John F. Kennedy, because his private life repeatedly put his presidency at risk. Oddly, Kennedy's detractors -- those seeking to portray his so-called dark side -- have largely excluded Jackie from their versions of events, every bit as much as his apologists have. I would argue that one can come to terms neither with Kennedy's darker aspects nor with his fundamental decency -- nor, ultimately, with what was perhaps his most stunning unfinished achievement, his own personal struggle against unimaginable odds for a moral compass -- without being intimately familiar with the unusual nature of his life with her.</p><p>What follows is Jacqueline Kennedy's story in the White House years told fully for the first time in the larger and inseparable context of the presidency. It is also, in important ways, the story of the Kennedy presidency, with a tremendous missing piece filled in. To view the presidency afresh, rather than start with published memoirs and established histories, I have reconstructed the story from scratch, using the vast documentation produced during the Kennedy administration: letters, memos, transcripts, reports, diaries, and other primary sources. Using Secret Service reports of presidential movements, appointment books, gate logs, and other records, I have tracked the President and First Lady, as well as their intimates and associates, on a day-by-day, often minute-by-minute basis. With the aid of transcripts and minutes of meetings, I listened to what was actually said, by Kennedy himself and by key participants, during the many tumultuous events that made this presidency such an exciting one. I followed the President afterward, whether upstairs to the family quarters or to the Kennedys' weekend retreat in the country, to see him unwind with his wife and close friends. I considered what certain of those friends had to say about the Kennedys, whether in letters or diaries of the period, or in interviews. And I listened carefully to Jackie's own voice, in letters and other documents.</p><p>No experience can have been more valuable to me than the opportunity to study Jackie's extraordinarily moving, uncharacteristically frank correspondence with Harold Macmillan, written after her husband's death. As I encountered the passionate, emotionally turbulent, unguarded voice in those letters, and made sense of the allusions, both hers and Macmillan's, to certain defining events in the presidency, I was struck by how little has ever really been known about Jacqueline Kennedy or her intimate life with Jack in the White House years. In telling that story, it is my hope that, as I did, the reader will come to a better and more sympathetic understanding of two flawed but good and remarkable people, both of whom, each in his or her own way, came to exemplify the virtue both valued most: courage.</p><p>Copyright � 2001 by Barbara Leaming</p><p></p></p><h2>Franklin Rides A Bike</h2><p>The last of his friends who still needs training wheels for his bicycle, Franklin becomes increasingly discouraged as he continues to fall down, but his mother gently encourages him until he succeeds. Original.</p><p>Paulette Bourgeois is the author of more than 40 books for children, including the In My Neighborhood series and Oma&#39;s Quilt. She lives in Toronto, Ontario.Kindergarten-Grade 3. Two books that present slices of life that have significance for children. In Franklin's New Friend, the turtle befriends Moose, who's new in town, even though Franklin is afraid of him because he's so large. In the second title, Franklin feels left out when his friends learn to ride their bikes without training wheels. As he tries to overcome his fear of falling, he realizes that other activities, such as swimming, are easy for him. Finally, he decides to put pads on his knees and elbows, and he learns to ride. In both titles, the writing flows smoothly, while the bright, cheery watercolor illustrations match the books' sunny outlooks. The only drawback, especially in the first title, is the ease with which resolutions are reached. Franklin overcomes his uneasiness around Moose to become his friend all in one morning. While this may be unrealistic, the author does present a positive picture of accepting others regardless of physical differences.?Martha Topol, Traverse Area District Library, Traverse City, MI<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Naturalist in La Plata</h2><p>Celebrated nature classic offers unusual perspective on treeless grasslands of Argentina.

The book focuses on a specific incident-the shooting of a bull elk in Yellowstone National Park-and follows the case step-by-step. Interspersed with the story about this killing are "Wild Files" that give further information about the lab, the scientists, and related topics such as endangered wildlife protection laws. These inserts, alternating with two-page spreads of text, contain lots of intriguing information but their placement is a drawback. Although the main story is compelling, its continuity is continuously broken. Otherwise, this is an enjoyable, informative volume with well-placed, clear photos that add interest. Offer it to fans of the author's The Bone Detectives (Little, Brown, 1996) and nature enthusiasts, who will appreciate this foray into an intriguing and little-known area of wildlife conservation work.<br><i>Arwen Marshall, formerly at New York Public Library </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Delia&#39;s How to Cheat at Cooking</h2><p>In <b>How to Cheat at Cooking</b>, Delia has sourced a range of pre-prepared foods (from tins, chill cabinets, freezers and store cupboards) to help you short circuit cooking times and techniques.

Some smartass might even call him &#34;Dr.&#34; Ellison. But only once.

It is in this quiet confidence that the true strangeness and beauty of the work can emerge. . . . It is the cool telling that allows the tectonic plates of history, social forces and circumstances to move beneath these stories, conveying the feeling that something urgent and profound is at stake, beyond the lives of these striving, damaged and unforgettable characters.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Marie Myung-Ok Lee, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><p></p><br>&#x201c;This powerful debut collection takes an unflinching look at the reality of life in Korea. . . .

In the best stories, like the tragic yet luminous &#x2018;A Small Sorrow,&#x2019; the story of a flawed marriage and an artistic rivalry, Lee's psychological acuity is empathetic under its unsentimental portraiture.&#x201d;<p>&#x2014;<b><i>The Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></b></p><br>&#x201c;<i>Drifting House</i> has shades of Jhumpa Lahiri&#x2019;s <i>Unaccustomed Earth</i> in its rendering of split cultural identities.

The greatest strength of these nine stories is Lee&#x2019;s ability to locate them in the strange and brutal dimensions of lives distorted by dictatorship, exile, expatriation, and even hunger. Her stories also slide through the quiet violence of divorce, loneliness, parenthood, and erotic attraction. . . . Lee is a patient storyteller with a distanced, mostly omniscient point of view. Such a sweeping, plain-style narration is essential for lacing together a collection that unfolds in three countries. The even tone lifts these stories out of melodrama and turns them instead into pristine things that are as unsparing as they are compassionate.&#x201d;<p>&#x2014;<i><b>The Daily Beast</b></i></p><p><br>&#x201c;Identity, loneliness and survival haunt <i>Drifting House</i>, Krys Lee&#x2019;s debut collection of short stories. . . .

A farmer and violinist, Northup owned land in Hebron, New York. In 1841 he was kidnapped by slave traders, having been enticed to Washington, D.C. (where slavery was legal) with a job offer as a violinist with traveling entertainers. Shortly after he and his employers arrived in DC, they sold him as a slave, apparently having drugged him into unconsciousness to effect the kidnapping. He was shipped to New Orleans where he was sold to a planter in Louisiana. He was held in the Red River region of Louisiana by several different owners for 12 years, mostly in Avoyelles Parish.</p><h2>Heroes Are My Weakness: A Novel</h2><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Susan Elizabeth Phillips is back with a delightful novel filled with her sassy wit and dazzling charm</p><p><em>Deepest winter.<br>An isolated island off the coast of Maine.<br>A man.

An illegitimate child who never knew his parents, he was abandoned to the Public Assistance Authorities. He was ten when he was sent to a reformatory for stealing; thereafter he spent time in the prisons of nearly every country he visited in thirty years of prowling through the European underworld. With ten convictions for theft in France to his credit he was, the eleventh time, condemned to life imprisonment. Eventually he was granted a pardon by President Auriol as a result of appeals from France&#39;s leading artists and writers led by Jean Cocteau.$$$His first novel, Our Lady of the Flowers, was written while he was in prison, followed by Miracle of the Rose, the autobiographical The Thief&#39;s Journal, Querelle of Brest and Funeral Rites. He wrote six plays: The Balcony, The Blacks, The Screens, The Maids, Deathwatch and Splendid&#39;s (the manuscript of which was rediscovered only in 1993).

Pinney&#x2019;s work depicts not only the rites of American womanhood, but also the informal passages of girlhood and adolescence. With each view&#x2014;from solitary subjects in pensive moments to complex family and social situations&#x2014;the audience gains a richer understanding of the connections between a daughter and her parents, grandparents, and the larger world of friends and society. The pictures also reflect the ways in which a girl&#x2019;s world in 2010 differs from the world Pinney knew growing up in the 1960s, and the ways in which the making of a person can transcend time and place.</p><p><i>Girl Ascending </i>is a sequel to Pinney&#x2019;s widely praised first book, <i>Regarding Emma: Photographs of American Women and Girls</i>.

Reprint.</p><p>It sounds like a nightmare from decades ago: a black school janitor suspected of murder simply because of his race; evidence in his favor that somehow disappears; intimidated witnesses; judges and prosecutors who conspire to convict; and a death sentence. However, the case of Clarence Brandley--a gross perversion of justice--stings all the more because it happened in the 1980s in Conroe, Texas. Davies, a British reporter, spins a deeply disturbing tale of what was almost a legal lynching, concentrating on the courtroom drama and the lawyers, investigators, witnesses, and a priest who finally grasped justice for Brandley. He also profiles those who sought to keep justice away from him, including more likely suspects. Brandley's story at this time is still unfinished--he is free pending a new trial--and, as Davies eloquently points out, the story will not end as long as racism is still institutionalized in towns like Conroe. Extremely well written, dramatic, and thought-provoking, this is highly recommended. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 11/15/90-- Sally G.

This splitting of Mother and Daughter is the crux of the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone, a tale that holds as much meaning for us today as it did in ancient times. The story of how Demeter&#39;s daughter becomes Persephone, Queen of the Dead, and is ransomed back from death by her mother depicts profound psychological transformations. Writing from the perspectives of Jungian psychology and goddess spirituality, Kathie Carlson examines the deep reverberations of this myth in both ancient religion and the inner lives and relationships of contemporary men and women. Included in her discussion are: The Mother-Daughter archetype as feminine self Hades as shadow in men and animus in women The plight of women who &#34;live the myth backwards&#34; The Mystery path of Demeter Richly illustrated with dreams, insights, and relational dynamics drawn from psychotherapy clients, this book will appeal to both layperson and professional, and to anyone interested in myth, goddess-centered religion, or Jungian psychology.</p><p>Kathie Carlson is a writer and a psychotherapist in private practice in Connecticut. A teacher of feminine psychology in the ancient religion of the Goddess, she has led various workshops on women's issues and spiritual quest. Carlson brings to all of her work an extensive background in Jungian psychology as well as a particular interest in the feminine Self. She is the author of <i>In Her Image: The Unhealed Daughter's Search for Her Mother. </i></p><h2>Night&#39;s Child: A Detective Murdoch Mystery</h2><p>After thirteen-year-old Agnes Fisher faints at school, her teacher, the young and still idealistic Amy Slade, is shocked to discover in the girl&#x2019;s desk two stereoscopic photographs. One is of a dead baby in its cradle, and on the back Agnes has scrawled a terrible message. Worse, the other photograph is of Agnes in a pose captioned &#x201c;What Mr. Newly Wed Really Wants.&#x201d; When Agnes doesn&#x2019;t show up at school the next day, her teacher takes the two photographs to the police. Murdoch, furious at the sexual exploitation of such a young girl, resolves to find the photographer &#x2013; and to put him behind bars. <br><br><i>Night&#x2019;s Child</i> is the fifth novel in Maureen Jennings&#x2019;s highly praised historical mystery series.

For the moment, the room was quiet, the only sound was of chalk moving on slate boards. By rights the children should have been writing in notebooks, but Miss Slade had taken spare slates from the lower standards and used them for rough work. &#x201c;Then you �don&#x2019;t have to worry about perfection, which as we know �doesn&#x2019;t exist,&#x201d; she told her pupils. She caught the eye of Emmanuel Hart and frowned at him.<br><br>&#x201c;How many times must I remind you, Emmanuel? The mind is like a muscle and must be exercised else it grow flabby and inert.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy bent his head immediately to the task of long division. He was a big boy, too old to still be in the fourth standard, but he had missed a lot of school and his reading and writing was barely at the level of the younger children. In a different classroom he would have been either the bully or the butt of ridicule. Not here. Miss Slade, without ever resorting to the cane, ran a tight, disciplined ship. She was strict about what she called the rules of order, which she&#x2019;d established on the first day of the term. No talking when there was work to be done; only one voice at a time when there was a question-�and-�answer period; absolutely no tormenting of other children. Any infraction of these rules and the offending child, almost always one of the boys, was sent to the Desk of Thoughtfulness, which was right under her nose. Here he had to sit and reflect on his behaviour while all around him the class enjoyed the games and competitions that Miss Slade used to liven up her lessons. &#x201c;Learning should be the most fun you ever have,&#x201d; she told her pupils. And so she made it. On her desk was a large jar full of brightly coloured boiled sweets. The winner of the competition could choose one. But it was not just the succulent bribery of raspberry drops that won the children&#x2019;s devotion, even though that helped a great deal. What they came to respect most was Miss Slade&#x2019;s justice. She dispensed praise and occasional scoldings with an absolutely even hand whether it was to a hopeless case like Emmanuel Hart or to Mary, the clever, exquisitely dressed daughter of Councillor Blong. One or two of the girls, already too prissy to be saved, disliked and mistrusted her, but the others loved her.<br><br>This was Miss Slade&#x2019;s third year of teaching at Sackville Street School and her fourth placement. Although her pupils �didn&#x2019;t know it, her contract was precarious. She was far too radical a teacher for the board&#x2019;s taste, and if she �hadn&#x2019;t consistently produced such excellent results, she would have been dismissed long ago.<br><br>She waited a moment longer, enjoying the <i>put, put</i> sound of the chalk on the slates. Then she clapped her hands.<br><br>"Excellent. There is nothing quite as fine as the silence of the intelligent mind at work. What is it that makes so much noise? Hands up if you know the answer.&#x201d;<br><br>Every arm shot up, hands waving like fronds.<br><br>&#x201c;Good. I would expect you to know the answer to that as I have said it innumerable times. Who �hasn&#x2019;t answered a question lately? Benjamin Fisher, you.&#x201d;<br><br>The skinny boy&#x2019;s face lit up. &#x201c;The most noise in the brain comes from the rattle of empty thoughts, Miss Slade.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. You can get a sweet later. Now, wipe off your slates, everybody, and put them in your desks.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a little flurry of activity, desk lids lifted, as the children did as she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Monitors, open the windows wide, if you please.&#x201d;<br><br>Florence Birrell and Emmanuel Hart got up promptly and went to push up the window sashes. Cold air poured into the classroom, which was hot and stuffy. The large oil heater in the centre of the room dried out the air. The girls who were sitting closest to the windows wrapped their arms in their pinafores for warmth while the boys remained stoic.<br><br>&#x201c;Good! Stand beside your desks, everybody, and assume your positions for cultivation of the chest.&#x201d;<br><br>The children stood in the aisles, their heels pressed together, toes turned out at an angle.<br><br>&#x201c;Remember now, your weight must be forward on the balls of your feet. Let me see. Rise up.&#x201d;<br><br>One or two of the boys deliberately lost their balance, which gave them an excuse to flail their arms and grab on to the desk beside them.<br><br>&#x201c;George Strongithorn, stop that. You will sit out the exercise in the Desk of Thoughtfulness if you misbehave again. You are quite capable of standing on your toes. All right, children, you may assume your correct position once more.&#x201d;<br><br>Miss Slade began to walk up and down, inspecting her pupils. She had her cane pointer in her hand but not to whack at any child, merely to correct.<br><br>Benjamin&#x2019;s older sister, Agnes Fisher, who was directly in front of the open window, shivered violently. She was wearing only a thin cotton jersey underneath her pinafore.<br><br>&#x201c;Agnes, come to the front. It&#x2019;s warmer out of the air.&#x201d;<br><br>Miss Slade faced the class. &#x201c;Now, all together. Inhale . . . and exhale as you say the word <i>far</i>. Whispers please. <i>Farrr</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a soft sighing throughout the room.<br><br>&#x201c;Twice more. Joseph, for goodness sake, your mouth should be closed, not catching flies.&#x201d;<br><br>A giggle ran through the ranks.<br><br>Miss Slade, whose chest was well cultivated, lead the way. &#x201c;Inhale through the right nostril only. And exhale through the left nostril.&#x201d;<br><br>Henry Woolway had a bad cold and blew out some snot as he exhaled. He wiped it away with his sleeve. Without comment Miss Slade handed him a clean handkerchief from her pocket.<br><br>The children continued to breathe, first through one nostril then the other, puny chests thrust out and upward.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, we will pause for a moment. Isaiah, you are still prone to making your shoulders do all the work. That is wrong. It is the lower chest that must rise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, Miss Slade. My chest bone hurts if I breathe in too deep.&#x201d;<br><br>Isaiah had a persistent dry cough.<br><br>She tapped hard on her own chest with her two fingers. &#x201c;This is what you must do every day without fail, Isaiah. Firm percussion for five minutes. Then splash cold water on your neck and chest, followed by a dry warm towel. Within three weeks, we should see some improvement.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br><br>There were four younger children in Isaiah&#x2019;s family and the closest he got to water in the morning was a damp rag that his mother made him whisk around the face and ears of the two next down. She �didn&#x2019;t seem to notice whether he did the same to himself. Miss Slade read his face correctly.<br><br>&#x201c;On second thoughts, Isaiah, we&#x2019;ll do the exercise when you come to school and I will be able to supervise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Master on the Periphery of Capitalism: Machado de Assis (Post-Contemporary Interventions)</h2><p><i>A Master on the Periphery of Capitalism</i> is a translation (from the original Portuguese) of Roberto Schwarz&#x2019;s renowned study of the work of Brazilian novelist Machado de Assis (1839&#x2013;1908). A leading Brazilian theorist and author of the highly influential notion of &#x201c;misplaced ideas,&#x201d; Schwarz focuses his literary and cultural analysis on Machado&#x2019;s <i>The Posthumous Memoirs of Br�s Cubas</i>, which was published in 1880. Writing in the Marxist tradition, Schwarz investigates in particular how social structure gets internalized as literary form, arguing that Machado&#x2019;s style replicates and reveals the deeply embedded class divisions of nineteenth-century Brazil.<br> Widely acknowledged as the most important novelist to have written in Latin America before 1940, Machado had a surprisingly modern style. Schwarz notes that the unprecedented wit, sarcasm, structural inventiveness, and mercurial changes of tone and subject matter found in <i>The Posthumous Memoirs of Br�s Cubas</i> marked a crucial moment in the history of Latin American literature. He argues that Machado&#x2019;s vanguard narrative reflects the Brazilian owner class and its peculiar status in both national and international contexts, and shows why this novel&#x2019;s success was no accident. The author was able to confront some of the most prestigious ideologies of the nineteenth century with some uncomfortable truths, not the least of which was that slavery remained the basis of the Brazilian economy.<br> <i>A Master on the Periphery of Capitalism </i>will appeal to those with interests in Latin American literature, nineteenth century history, and Marxist literary theory.<br> <br></p><p>&#34;This is a masterpiece of criticism. The coherence of Schwarz&#39;s perspective and the clarity with which he elaborates the economic and cultural insights that form his dialectical approach to literature make his study a paradigmatic one for theoretical enterprise. By concentrating his interpretive talents on Machado&#39;s style, Schwarz also illuminates a question that has puzzled many present Machado readers: Why do we find him so satisfylingly contemporary?&#34;--Leslie Damasceno, Duke University<p>Roberto Schwarz, one of Brazil&#x2019;s foremost literary and cultural critics, is the author of <i>Misplaced Ideas: Essays on Brazilian Culture </i>and <i>Duas Meninas.</i> John Gledson is Emeritus Professor of Brazilian Studies at the University of Liverpool.

She is married with three children and lives near Maidstone, Kent The fifth book in the series, LAST SEEN ALIVE, won the Crime Writers&#39; Association Award in 1985.This mild and methodical mystery unfolds in a picturesque English village where gentlemanly detective-inspector Luke Thanet is hard-pressed to discover who pushed beautiful but unpleasant Nerine Tarrant over the second-story balcony of her manor "High Gables" to her death below. There is no lack of suspects, and Thanet, with stolid, respectable Sgt. Lineham at his side, is kept busy interviewing them. Did Nerine's husband Roland, although seemingly shattered by her death, finally seek revenge for her many infidelities? Could her senile mother-in-law, terrified at Nerine's threats to send her to a nursing home, have given her the fatal shove? What about Celia Speed, whose husband and son were both having affairs with the promiscuous Mrs. Tarrant? Even Nerine's 18-year-old-son Damon and her sister Daphne may have their own complicated reasons for wanting her dead. Kindly, pipe-smoking, utterly domestic Thanet gently probes into every aspect of village life, carefully gleaning leads from the most recalcitrant suspect. The seventh book in the Luke Thanet series is a bloodless mystery with emphasis on a thoughtful, logically persued course of action that does, however, end up being solidly charming. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gettysburg (Landmark Books)</h2><p>When troops entered Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the South seemed to be winning the Civil War.

This is the moment when we are finally free to make choices outside the powerful tug of expectation, ambition, and struggle. We have reached what I call the age of reason. Now we can choose to live not for others, but for ourselves, and we can take time to explore a life of inner knowledge for which we were always too busy. </p><p> For me the chaos of city life, heightened by the fear of terrorism and the culture of technology that forced me to remember codes and numbers to access even my own personal information, further pushed me to reevaluate what life should be about. I realized I was inundated by information and misinformation from our leadership and the media -- and that it was slowly eroding my spirit. I was falling out of touch with my own inner truth. These realizations were slow in coming, but the important thing is that they finally did arrive. </p><p> So several years ago I decided to make my year-round home on an 8,000-acre Spanish land grant that used to be an old cattle ranch just outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico. It's a peaceful place, and sometimes deafeningly silent, with ancient energies that communicate to me in nameless ways. I live there with people who take care of me, and friends who come and stay, as well as nine dogs, three horses, ducks, platoons of birds, a pond, streams, deer, elk, bears, mountain lions, coyotes, and a host of spectacular plant life. But the most important being on the ranch is my little dog, Terry. </p><p> I "acquired" Terry in Malibu, California, where I lived for fifty years and still keep a place for meetings. She and I grew closer and closer during the few years it took me to distance myself from Malibu, with its easy access to the movie business, and to shift my life to the high desert wilderness. But as with all events that are life-changing, I woke up one morning and knew in my soul that the city part of my life was over. I was moving on to a new adventure that would lead me to realize that perhaps Terry had acquired <i>me</i>. </p><p> This book is about hearing a deeper song of being that has made me more optimistic about what the future of life on this planet could be. It is based on the truth as I see it, and as it has been shown to me through the eyes of a dog. More to the point, I'm having a new experience with love. I have deeply enjoyed the love of children, friends, lovers, a husband, work, creativity, fame, travel, success, money, politics, controversy, and even struggle. But the love that has come to me through Terry is an exultant confirmation that love exists in many realities and forms, all of them longing to be acknowledged through wisdom, humor, simplicity, silence, and the wordless language of the heart. </p><p> Here is an account of what Terry is teaching me, now that I am taking time to listen. Her thoughts as they come to me are not articulated in English, but in a purer, more direct form, in a language I call "humanimal." I know that I am touching deeper truths because of the knowledge Terry shares with me, so I've set down those insights into words here, in hopes that you may benefit from them as well. </p><p> This book, then, is a rumination, a conversation between Terry and me. Those of you who have an animal and live in close proximity to nature will understand immediately. If you haven't allowed an animal or nature to "acquire" you, the journey through yourself will take a little longer. Either way, this journey is the only one worth taking. </p><p><br> </p><p> <i>The answers we seek are ours to create.</i> </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by Shirley MacLaine</p></p><h2>Fast: Poems</h2><p><p><strong>The first new collection of poetry in five years from Pulitzer Prize winner Jorie Graham</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Graham&#x2019;s great body of work has more of life and of the world than that of almost any other poet now writing. . . .

Killed at the front in Tula Province in 1941." This is all that remains of Ivan Chistyakov, a senior guard at the Baikal Amur Corrective Labour Camp.<br><br> Who was this lost man? How did he end up in the gulag? Though a guard, he is a type of prisoner, too. We learn that he is a cultured and urbane ex-city dweller with a secret nostalgia for pre-Revolutionary Russia. In this diary, Chistyakov does not just record his life in the camp, he narrates it. He is a sharp-eyed witness and a sympathetic, humane, and broken man.<br><br> From stumblingly poetic musings on the bitter landscape of the taiga to matter-of-fact grumbles about the inefficiency of his stove, from accounts of the brutal conditions of the camp to reflections on the cruelty of loneliness, this diary is an astonishing record&#x2015;a visceral and immediate description of a place and time whose repercussions still affect the shape of modern Russia, and modern Europe.</p><p><p><strong>Ivan Chistyakov</strong> was a Muscovite who was expelled from the Communist Party during the purges of the late 1920s and early 1930s. He commanded an armed guard unit on a section of BAM, the Baikal-Amur Mainline, which was built by forced labor.

To date he has translated twenty-seven books from Russian, most recently the memoirs of Akhmed Zakayev.</p>&#x201c;Lacking the overt arc of a plotted narrative, this diary nonetheless conveys the increasing hopelessness of life at a forced-labor camp. Chistyakov provides a singular account from a category of gulag witnesses whose voices have rarely been heard&#x2015;those who were neither the main victims nor the instigators of a brutal system but its unwilling enforcers, doomed to bit parts in both roles.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A chilling, revealing diary of a reluctant gulag prison guard.

Who are the women who keep bees and what can we learn from them? <i>Beeconomy</i> examines the fascinating evolution of the relationship between women and bees around the world.

By a New York Times best-selling author. (fantasy). Simultaneous.</p><p><b>Terry Brooks</b> has thrilled readers for decades with his powers of imagination and storytelling. He is the author of more than thirty books, most of which have been <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. He lives with his wife, Judine, in the Pacific Northwest.One<br><br>Paxon Leah was sitting on a bench in the courtyard gardens of Paranor, paging through documents written more than five hundred years earlier that recorded the events in the life of the Elf King Eventine Elessedil, when Keratrix came for him. He could tell immediately from the scribe&#x2019;s solemn face that something was wrong.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s asking for you,&#x201d; the other said without preamble. His eyes seemed tired and haunted. &#x201c;She says it&#x2019;s time.&#x201d;<br><br>Paxon stared. On a beautiful, sunny day like this one? On a day when everything felt right, and it seemed that the world was at peace and life could go on indefinitely? How could this be?<br><br>That was what he thought as he measured the scribe&#x2019;s words and let their meaning sink in. He didn&#x2019;t have to ask what Keratrix meant. He knew. He had known this was coming. She had told him so herself.<br><br>Aphenglow Elessedil, Ard Rhys of the Fourth Druid Order, was dying.<br><br>He rose at once, wordless and shaken, and followed Keratrix from the gardens into the tower that housed her private chambers. The Ard Rhys kept to herself these days, weakened by age and worn down by both the demands of her office and the passage of time. She was housed on the lower floors, no longer able to handle the stairs and the climb that going to her former chambers and to the upper reaches of the main tower required. She had not been in the cold room in over a year. She had not used the scrye waters once in all that time, relying instead on her chosen successor, Isaturin, to carry out her duties. She was in stasis, waiting for the inevitable. If the truth were told, Paxon believed, she was anxious for it to arrive.<br><br>And now, apparently, it had.<br><br>&#x201c;Is she sure?&#x201d; he asked Keratrix as they walked. When he looked at the young Druid, he was reminded of Sebec. Five years earlier, Sebec&#x2014;�then scribe of the Druid Order&#x2014;�had been his closest friend at Paranor, and the betrayal of that friendship was a wound that still burned in his memory.<br><br>Keratrix&#x2014;�slight and small, scarcely a presence as he wafted ahead of Paxon like a wraith in the shadowed hallways&#x2014;�barely turned. &#x201c;She insists she is quite sure. I asked this, as well.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course he would. Keratrix was efficient and thorough; he would not leave something like this undone.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe it,&#x201d; Paxon whispered, almost to himself, though he knew Keratrix must have heard.<br><br>And he could not. Five years he had spent as the personal paladin of the Ard Rhys, as the High Druid&#x2019;s Blade. She had brought him to Paranor at a time when he was drifting. She had offered him the position in large part because of his heritage as a bearer of the magical Sword of Leah. She had given him over to training and had kept watch from a distance as he struggled to find his place. When his sister Chrysallin had been taken by the sorcerer Arcannen, Aphenglow was the one who had helped him to get Chrys back and then found a home for her at Paranor&#x2014;�even though Chrysallin had been sent to kill her and had almost succeeded. And all the while, she had been beset by Sebec&#x2019;s betrayal and Arcannen&#x2019;s scheming to gain control of the order.<br><br>But perhaps even more important than that, she had taken Chrysallin into the order as a student in training, aware of the importance of the gift she possessed and the need to find a way to manage it. For like her brother, Chrysallin Leah bore a legacy of magic. Paxon&#x2019;s was the ability to unlock the power of the Sword of Leah. Chrysallin&#x2019;s was the presence of the wishsong, which she had inherited as a direct descendant of Railing Ohmsford. However, Chrys remained unaware of her powers. Arcannen had kidnapped her in an attempt to use her as a weapon against the Ard Rhys, but the subsequent trauma of the events that followed had wiped away any memory of those powers. Still, Aphenglow was convinced that her memory would eventually return.<br><br>So she had let Chrysallin remain at Paranor, keeping close watch over her and waiting for the moment when her magic would resurface and she could be given over to members of the order who would help her learn to master it&#x2014;�who would train her in its usage and teach her of the importance it held not only in her own life but in the lives of those around her.<br><br>So far, that moment had not arrived. To this day, Chrysallin remembered nothing, and no sign of the magic had reappeared. Now, as the Ard Rhys prepared for the end of her life, the task of watching over his sister would fall to Paxon. He was ready to accept this, he believed. More ready than he was for what waited just ahead.<br><br>As they neared the entry to Aphenglow Elessedil&#x2019;s room, the door opened and Isaturin appeared. Tall, gaunt, strong-�featured, and steady in his gaze, he seemed lessened in all aspects as he approached Paxon. Undoubtedly, he was coming to terms with what the Ard Rhys&#x2019;s passing would mean for him. He was her designated successor, the next Ard Rhys, and the new High Druid of what would continue as the Fourth Druid Order. He had known of his future for many years; she had made certain of it. But it was one thing to know what lay ahead of you and another altogether to have it standing there at your doorstep.<br><br>&#x201c;She is waiting for you, Paxon,&#x201d; Isaturin said, slowing to meet him. &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t have much time, and the journey ahead of us is a long one.&#x201d;<br><br>Paxon stared. &#x201c;Journey? Do you mean her dying?&#x201d;<br><br>Isaturin shook his head. &#x201c;No, not that. She will explain. Hurry now. No lingering.&#x201d;<br><br>He moved away, leaving the Highlander looking after him in confusion.<br><br>Keratrix touched his arm. &#x201c;Go in, Paxon. I&#x2019;ll wait out here.&#x201d;<br><br>Paxon went to the door, knocked softly, and heard her voice in response. Though he could not understand her words, he took a deep breath and entered anyway.<br><br>&#x201c;Paxon,&#x201d; she greeted him.<br><br>That single word almost undid him. Everything she meant to him, everything she had done for him, all they had shared together seemed caught up in the moment. Memories flooded through him, some sad, some happy, all incredibly vivid&#x2014;�a jumble of connections realized in seconds. He stood where he was, weathering the onslaught, frozen in place.<br><br>Then he looked up from the spot on the floor to which his gaze had fastened and saw her. Whatever he had expected to find, it wasn&#x2019;t this. She was sitting up in her favorite chair, a blanket spread across her knees and her hands in her lap, clasped together. She looked old, but not sick; worn, but not broken. Her face radiated strength and certainty, and she had about her an aura of invincibility that caused him to blink in disbelief.<br><br>&#x201c;You thought perhaps to find me abed and failing?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;You thought I might be breathing my last?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded, unable to speak.<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t work that way. High Druids go to their end with some measure of dignity and strength so they can face what awaits. Sit with me.&#x201d;<br><br>He took the chair across from her. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look as if you are dying,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;You look very well, Mistress.&#x201d;<br><br>Her face was lined by her years and the stresses and struggles she had endured and survived. She was very thin, and her skin had the look of parchment wrapped about bones. He had seen pictures of her when she was young&#x2014;�portraits and sketches executed by Druids who possessed such skills as would allow them to capture her image accurately. It was said she had been beautiful&#x2014;�tall and strong, a warrior Elf and the descendant of Elven Kings and Queens. He could see traces of that in her even now&#x2014;�small indicators of what she had been years ago.<br><br>&#x201c;Kind words, Paxon. But in spite of what you think you see, my passing is at hand. I must go to my rest in the way of all leaders of the order&#x2014;�and for that, I require your company. I wish you to make the journey with me to the Valley of Shale and the Hadeshorn, where I will be met and taken home. I would like to leave at once. Though I may look strong, I can feel myself failing. It is a scary thing to be strong one moment and know that in the next your life will be over. Will you accompany me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he said at once. &#x201c;Should I arrange transport?&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;What happens once we get there?&#x201d;<br><br>She gave him that old, familiar smile. &#x201c;Best wait and see for yourself. I am not as certain of it as I would like to be. And don&#x2019;t give any further thought to arranging for an airship. Isaturin is taking care of that now. Just sit with me. Keep me company.&#x201d;<br><br>Paxon sat back. &#x201c;Do the others in the Druid Order know this is happening?&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head. &#x201c;Keratrix will tell them once I am gone. If he tells them now, there will be an unending line of mourners and well-�wishers, and I don&#x2019;t think I can bear that. I want to depart this world quietly. When my sister Arling left me all those years ago&#x2014;�when she embraced the fate decreed for her and transformed into the Ellcrys&#x2014;�well, that was quite enough trauma and emotional turmoil for several lifetimes.

Then she wiped them away unself-�consciously and smiled at Paxon. &#x201c;I have never gotten over losing her. Not even after all these years.&#x201d;<br><br>Paxon shifted uneasily, not knowing what to say.<br><br>&#x201c;I have revealed the situation with Chrysallin to Isaturin as the next head of the order,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I have told him of my fears and of my plans for her should her memory of the wishsong resurface. He will act in my place as her mentor and teacher when it becomes necessary. But I rely mostly on you to keep watch over her, Paxon. You are closest to her and likely to notice first if any changes occur. She will be safe at Paranor from everything save herself. You must help her with that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; he promised.<br><br>She straightened, and for a moment he thought she intended to rise. But she remained seated and added, &#x201c;At some point, Chrysallin will discover the truth. I am convinced of it. I don&#x2019;t know what effect it will have on her, but you need to be there to help her through it. So don&#x2019;t fool yourself into thinking this will never happen. I worry that your decision not to tell her is more an avoidance than a kindness. You hope she will never remember what happened to her, what she had to do to save herself. But she will, Paxon. One day, she will. Don&#x2019;t fail in this. Tell her soon. Chrysallin&#x2019;s power is well documented in the records, and it is a powerful and sometimes unpredictable weapon.&#x201d;<br><br>He leaned forward. &#x201c;I have been considering it. I am aware of the arguments for why I should tell her now. But I cannot get past the danger it poses if I am wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>She studied him a moment. &#x201c;I know you would like this to simply go away, but I don&#x2019;t think you can depend on that. So telling her in advance might be best. Use your good judgment on how to go about it if you decide to do so. She will listen to you. She adores you. Five years ago, it would have been hard to reveal the truth to her. But now she is grown; she is a woman, and her strength and maturity are much greater than when she first came to us.&#x201d;<br><br>He found himself amazed that Aphenglow Elessedil would take the time and effort to try to help with his sister when there was so much else she might be doing. But she was still Ard Rhys of the Fourth Druid Order, and she would have her priorities firmly in hand even at the end of her life. She would not deviate from who she had been and what she had done for well over a hundred years. That was her nature, a direct result of the demands of her position. She would want to set her house in order.<br><br>&#x201c;I owe you so much,&#x201d; he said, the words escaping him before he could think better of them. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve given me this life, and I will never forget that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You earned what you have, Paxon,&#x201d; she said quietly. &#x201c;No need to thank me for that.&#x201d;<br><br>He basked in her smile. &#x201c;Can I bring you something to drink? Or eat? Before we set out?&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head. &#x201c;We are not sitting here so that you can do something for me. We are here so that I can do something for you. Part of it is warning you of the risk to your sister. Another is warning you to beware of Arcannen. Do not think him gone for good&#x2014;�no more than Chrysallin&#x2019;s wishsong. He is a dangerous man with a long memory. He will be back for you and for Chrys. He will not tolerate leaving what you cost him unavenged. He will not be able to live with the humiliation and regret. When you least expect it, he will surface again, and he will seek to exact a price for what he has suffered.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am not afraid of him,&#x201d; Paxon declared at once.<br><br>&#x201c;You should be. He nearly undid the Druid Order before you stopped him. He is capable of great evil. Watch out for him. Be careful of yourself and your sister.&#x201d;<br><br>She paused. &#x201c;One last thing. Isaturin will need time to learn his place as Ard Rhys. No one can prepare for this until they hold the office. It was so for me; it will be so for him. Help him adjust. Give him your support. Keep him safe. You are fully grown into your paladin shoes, a young man with great skill and the good sense to know how to use it. Make use of it for him. Be his right hand and protector in these early months of his service to the order. Now take my arm.&#x201d;<br><br>She reached out, and he rose quickly to assist her. Her arm caught hold of his and she levered herself to her feet smoothly, suddenly seeming younger and stronger. She smiled at the look on his face.<br><br>&#x201c;Now we can go,&#x201d; she said.</p><h2>The Chessmen Of Mars (Ballantine 23582, Mars #5)</h2><p>&#34;1922. After a rambunctious youth and series of short-lived jobs including door-to-door salesman, accountant, a peddler for a quack alcoholism cure and finally pencil sharpener wholesaler, Burroughs found his calling as writer. As the story goes, one of Burroughs&#39; duties was to verify the placement of advertisements for his sharpeners in various magazines. These were all-fiction pulp magazines, a prime source of escapist reading material for the expanding middle class. Burroughs spent time reading those magazines and decided he could write those stories just as well. He was lucky his first time out and sold Under the Moon of Mars. The Tarzan series followed this and Burroughs was now a full-fledged writer. In this volume of the Mars series, Helium, a spoiled princess and John Carter&#39;s daughter, rejects Gahan, Jed of Gathol, as a suitor and foolishly flies off into a great storm. Gahan gives chase. By the time he finally catches up to Tara, she has forgotten who he is, and he assumes the name Turjun, a panthan mercenary. Together they challenge the power of O-Tar, Jeddak of Manator, whose barbaric nation of Red Men have preyed upon Gathol for centuries. The Manatorians have elevated Jetan, Martian chess, to an unprecedented level of skill and excitement: they use live chessmen who fight for live princesses. Gahan finds himself fighting for Tara on the chessboard of Manator, and haunting O-Tar&#39;s palace.&#34;</p><p>This book is a large print version using a minimum of 16 point type in a 6 by 9 inch size and library bound.

Ellen Craft (1826&#x2013;1891) and William Craft (September 25, 1824 &#x2013; January 29, 1900)[1] were slaves from Macon, Georgia in the United States who escaped to the North in December 1848 by traveling openly by train and steamboat, arriving in Philadelphia on Christmas Day. She passed as a white male planter and he as her personal servant. Their daring escape was widely publicized, making them among the most famous of fugitive slaves. Abolitionists featured them in public lectures to gain support in the struggle to end the institution. As the light-skinned quadroon daughter of a mulatto slave and her white master, Ellen Craft used her appearance to pass as a white man, dressed in male clothing, during their escape. As prominent fugitives, they were threatened by slave catchers in Boston after passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, so the Crafts emigrated to England. They lived there for nearly two decades and reared five children. The Crafts lectured publicly about their escape. In 1860 they published a written account, Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom; Or, The Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery. One of the most compelling of the many slave narratives published before the American Civil War, their book reached wide audiences in Great Britain and the United States. After their return to the US in 1868, the Crafts opened an agricultural school for freedmen's children in Georgia. They worked at the school and its farm until 1890. Ellen planned to take advantage of her appearance to pass as white while the pair traveled by train and boat to the North; she dressed as a man and pretended illness to limit conversation. William was to act as her slave and personal servant. During that time period, domestic slaves frequently accompanied their masters during travel, so the Crafts did not expect to be questioned. Their escape is known as the most ingenious plot in fugitive slave history, even more ingenious than "Henry Box Brown".[6] During their escape they traveled on first-class trains, stayed in the best hotels, and Ellen dined one evening with a steamboat captain. Ellen cut her hair and bought appropriate clothes to pass as a young man, traveling in jacket and trousers. William used his earnings as a cabinet-maker to buy clothes for Ellen to appear as a white slave holder. They carefully selected clothes that white male slave holders would wear. Ellen's wardrobe included a top hat, cravat, jacket, tartan, and a tassel, all of which signified slave holder status. William fixed her hair to add to her manly appearance. Ellen also practiced to get gestures and behavior right.[6] She wore her right arm in a sling to hide the fact that she did not know how to write. They traveled to nearby Macon for a train to Savannah. Although the Crafts had several close calls along the way and neither could read nor write, they were successful in evading detection. On December 21, they boarded a steamship for Philadelphia, in the free state of Pennsylvania, where they arrived early on the morning of Christmas Day.[7] Their innovation was in escaping as a pair. Historians have noted other slave women who posed as men to escape, such as Clarissa Davis of Virginia, who dressed as a man and took a New England-bound ship to freedom; Mary Millburn, who also sailed as a male passenger; and Maria Weems from the District of Columbia. As a young woman of fifteen, she dressed as a man and escaped.</p><p>William Craft (1821-1900) and Ellen Craft (1826-1891) returned to the United States after the Civil War. For the rest of their lives, often at great personal risk, they worked to improve conditions for African Americans in the South. Barbara McCaskill is an associate professor of English at the University of Georgia and a founding editor of the journal &#34;Womanist Theory and Research.&#34;<p><i>Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom</i> is the most significant fugitive slave narrative to come out of Georgia. I know of no other account that provides as riveting an account of an actual escape experience. It offers so much more in its treatment of gender and racial role-reversals, of husband-wife and master-slave relations, and of abolitionist activity on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line.</p> (<i>Georgia Historical Quarterly</i>)</p><h2>Hot Tub Religion: Christian Living in a Materialistic World</h2><p>A timely and practical collection of essays and thoughts on contemporary Christian living from a concerned theologian.</p><p></p><h2>Making Dolls&#39; House Interiors: Decor and Furnishings in 1/12 Scale</h2><p>Offering ideas for decorating schemes, furniture and accessories for dolls&#39; houses, this book presents a range of projects for houses of different periods.

As the Third Reich embarked upon its plan of conquest and genocide, help was needed to create the enabling technological solutions, step by step, from the identification and cataloguing programs of the 1930s to the selections of the 1940s. Only after Jews were identified - a massive and complex task that Hitler wanted done immediately - could they be targeted for swift asset confiscation, the creation of ghettos, deportations, enslaved labour and, ultimately, annihilation. This organizational challenge was so monumental it called for a computer. Of course, in the 1930s, no computer existed. However, IBM&#39;s punch-card technology did exist, with a proven track record throughout Europe. Edwin Black shows how, with the company&#39;s custom-designed and constantly updated Hollerith systems, Hitler was able to turn his persecution of the Jews into an automated and systematic process. Historians have always been amazed at the speed and accuracy with which the Nazis during their reign of terror were able to identify and locate German and other European Jews. The pieces of this puzzle have never been assembled, although it was known that punch-card technology played a vital role. The author alleges that IBM technology organized nearly everything in Germany and then Nazi Europe, from the identification of the Jews in censuses, registrations, and ancestral tracing programmes to the running of railroads and organizing concentration camp registration. IBM and its German subsidiary, Dehomag, Black says, custom-designed and tailored the complex applications and solutions one by one, anticipating the Reich&#39;s needs. They did not merely sell the machines, he shows, but leased and serviced them for high fees, becoming the sole source of the billions of punch-cards Hitler needed. Dehomag are shown to have trained Nazi officers, including concentration camp administrators, to use the IBM devices and their custom-designed applications. The book takes the reader through what the author believes was a carefully crafted corporate collusion with the Third Reich, as well as the structured deniability of oral agreements, undated letters and the Geneva intermediaries - all undertaken as the newspapers blazed with accounts of persecution and destruction, invasion and spoliation. Furthermore, Black alleges that when the war was over, IBM launched an international campaign to recover all the monies its subsidiaries received for their work for the Third Reich. The author is also keen to show the compelling human drama of one of the 20th century&#39;s greatest minds, IBM founder Thomas Watson, the highest paid executive in America, who, he says, turned a blind eye to the Nazi programme and co-operated for the sake of profit and his own fascination with Hitler. Only with the assistance the author has documented was Hitler able to achieve the staggering numbers of the Holocaust. Essentially then, he argues that IBM organized the organizers of one of the worst genocides in world history. Decades later, Black says he found that IBM obstructed his research at every turn, denying him access to company documents and even its museum in Germany, moving files from place to place to keep them out of his reach. Through his own persistence, and with the help of researchers, archivists and historians in seven countries, he believes he has uncovered one of the last great mysteries of the Holocaust - how did Hitler get the names?</p><p>Was IBM, "The Solutions Company," partly responsible for the Final Solution? That's the question raised by Edwin Black's <i>IBM and the Holocaust</i>, the most controversial book on the subject since Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's <i>Hitler's Willing Executioners</i>. Black, a son of Holocaust survivors, is less tendentiously simplistic than Goldhagen, but his thesis is no less provocative: he argues that IBM founder Thomas Watson deserved the Merit Cross (Germany's second-highest honor) awarded him by Hitler, his second-biggest customer on earth. "IBM, primarily through its German subsidiary, made Hitler's program of Jewish destruction a technologic mission the company pursued with chilling success," writes Black. "IBM had almost single-handedly brought modern warfare into the information age [and] virtually put the 'blitz' in the <i>krieg</i>." <p> The crucial technology was a precursor to the computer, the IBM Hollerith punch card machine, which Black glimpsed on exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Museum, inspiring his five-year, top-secret book project. The Hollerith was used to tabulate and alphabetize census data. Black says the Hollerith and its punch card data ("hole 3 signified homosexual ... hole 8 designated a Jew") was indispensable in rounding up prisoners, keeping the trains fully packed and on time, tallying the deaths, and organizing the entire war effort. Hitler's regime was fantastically, suicidally chaotic; could IBM have been the cause of its sole competence: mass-murdering civilians? Better scholars than I must sift through and appraise Black's mountainous evidence, but clearly the assessment is overdue.</p><p> The moral argument turns on one question: How much did IBM New York know about IBM Germany's work, and when? Black documents a scary game of brinksmanship orchestrated by IBM chief Watson, who walked a fine line between enraging U.S. officials and infuriating Hitler. He shamefully delayed returning the Nazi medal until forced to--and when he did return it, the Nazis almost kicked IBM and its crucial machines out of Germany. (Hitler was prone to self-defeating decisions, as demonstrated in <i>How Hitler Could Have Won World War II</i>.) </p><p> Black has created a must-read work of history. But it's also a fascinating business book examining the colliding influences of personality, morality, and cold strategic calculation. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>IBM and the Holocaust</b> is the stunning story of IBM's strategic alliance with Nazi Germany -- beginning in 1933 in the first weeks that Hitler came to power and continuing well into World War II.

There, amid the antics of blue-footed boobies and red-lipped batfish, Jane sets off on a quest through her family history to pinpoint the moment when Martha was no longer the Martha she knew. In the process, she ponders instinct, natural selection, and the oddities of evolution that transform us. As Barbara Kingsolver proclaimed in the <i>New York Times Book Review, </i>"We should rejoice in a rare novel like <i>The Evolution of Jane . . . </i>a rollicking family saga tinged with hints of sexual intrigue . . . Three cheers."&nbsp;<br><br>*<i>Elle</i> <p></p></p><p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that when a Cathleen Schine heroine goes off in search of her origins, she's likely to travel farther than most--and bound to come up against more than the average obstacle. Jane Barlow Schwartz, for instance, heads not for her New England childhood home but for the consolations of the Galapagos Islands. "You're searching for your roots," her father quips. "On a dormant volcano?" And this is only one of the thousands of witticisms on offer in Cathleen Schine's novel of lost friendship, the perplexing power of the family feud, and more than one shipboard mystery. When Jane, 25 and a brand-new divorc�e, arrives in Ecuador for her ecological tour, she instantly recognizes the guide as her relative and childhood best friend. Martha, the cousin in question, however, takes several beats longer--a clear signal that both still have some evolving to do. As Jane quickly reveals, Martha was the real grand passion in her life, and now she's determined to get to the bottom of her idol's disenchantment, not to mention explore the evolutionary value of friendship. Charles Darwin is definitely much in evidence in <i>The Evolution of Jane</i>, and Schine has some serious fun with Jane's confusion when it comes to species survival. But her fifth novel is also filled with some provocative, perfectly timed aper�us on natural, romantic, and most definitely familial selection. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>"We should rejoice in a rare book like <i>The Evolution of Jane </i>. . .

The slight revision consists of confining the dialectical spellings to the dialogue, and of omitting one theological detail in the original which would suggest that human beings who have had a spell put on them by the fairies are eternally damned, in order to support the idea that human beings have free will, which is consistent with Mrs. Kavanagh&#39;s later book, specifically her short story, Patrick of the Bells.What a rare and marvelous gem! Herminie Kavanagh's Darby O'Gill and the Good People takes its place alongside C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia and Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows as among this century's greatest works of moral imagination. There's more poetry and magic here than in all the new fiction that will be released this year. Anyone who knows or wants to know the heart of the Irish should read this book.-- James Bemis, Los Angeles Daily News columnist <p>Children (12 years and up) and adults will love the story of our hero, Darby O'Gill, that daring Tipperary man, and the Good People (also known as fairies and leprechauns) in turn-of-the-century Ireland. Long out of print, this is the original story on which the 1959 Walt Disney movie was based, much beloved the world over. </p><p>This collection of tales includes the story of Darby's fantastic sojourn among the fairies, in which he cleverly escapes their mountain home, yet wins the friendship of King Brian Connors of the Good People. You'll be fascinated by the story of how the Good People were expelled from heaven and banished to earth, and why they choose Ireland as their home. You'll laugh at the hilarious adventures of King Brian when he is caught out after cock-crow and becomes as helpless as a baby. And in the last chapter, perhaps the most thrilling of the book, Darby does battle and matches wits with the banshee and the ghosts--with the aid of King Brian and the Good People: </p><p>Twas then Darby just nearly gave up for lost. He felt his eyes growing dim and his limbs numb. There was no air coming into his lungs so that he knew the black spell was on him, and all that was left for him to do was to sink down in the road and then to die. </p><p>But at that minute there floated from a great way off the faint cry of a voice the despairing man knew well. </p><p>Keep up your heart, Darby O'Gill, cried Brian Connors; we're coming to resky you, and from over the fields a wild cheer followed them words. </p><p>Faugh-a-balla--clear the way! sprang the shrill war-cry of a thousand of the Good People. </p><p>So fast came the King's fairy army that the great cheer was still echoing among the trees when the gold crown of Brian Connors sparkled up from beside the knowledgeable man's knees. At that the persecuted man, sobbing with joy, knelt down in the muddy road to shake hands with his friend, the master of the Good People. </p><p>So welcome to the world of Darby O'Gill--a world of great fun, good people, and grand laughter.</p></p><h2>Lea and Camila (American Girl: Girl of the Year, 3)</h2><p>For spring break, Lea has invited her friend Camila to St. Louis for a stateside adventure.

For many, his watercolors capture the spirit of midcentury England.

Drawing on extensive research, Andy Friend considers the predecessors in the English watercolor and wood-engraving tradition that influenced the group&#x2019;s art and demonstrates the significance of women artists, whose place within this interwar-era network has often been neglected.</p><p>Published to coincide with the seventy-fifth anniversary of Ravilious&#x2019;s death, <em>Ravilious &amp; Co.</em> accompanies an exhibition of the same name, touring throughout England in 2017.</p> 215 illustrations, 145 in color</p><p><p><strong>Andy Friend</strong> is a Ravilious expert and co-curator of Ravilious &amp; Co. at Towner Art Gallery in Eastbourne, UK.</p><p><strong>Alan Powers&nbsp;</strong>is a widely published author on twentieth-century art and design.

In Lost Harvests Sarah Carter reveals that reserve residents were anxious to farm and expended considerable effort on cultivation; government policies, more than anything else, acted to undermine their success. Despite repeated requests for assistance from Plains Indians, the Canadian government provided very little help between 1874 and 1885, and what little they did give proved useless. Although drought, frost, and other natural phenomena contributed to the failure of early efforts, reserve farmers were determined to create an economy based on agriculture and to become independent of government regulations and the need for assistance. Officials in Ottawa, however, attributed setbacks not to economic or climatic conditions but to the Indians&#39; character and traditions which, they claimed, made the Indians unsuited to agriculture. In the decade following 1885 government policies made farming virtually impossible for the Plains Indians. They were expected to subsist on one or two acres and were denied access to any improvements in technology: farmers had to sow seed by hand, harvest with scythes, and thresh with flails. After the turn of the century, the government encouraged land surrenders in order to make good agricultural land available to non-Indian settlers. This destroyed any chance the Plains Indians had of making agriculture a stable economic base. Through an examination of the relevant published literature and of archival sources in Ottawa, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, Carter provides an in-depth study of government policy, Indian responses, and the socio-economic condition of the reserve communities on the prairies in the post-treaty era. The new introduction by the author offers a reflection on Lost Harvests, the influences that shaped it, and the issues and approaches that remain to be explored.</p><p>Sarah Carter is professor and Henry Marshall Tory Chair in the Department of History and Classics and the Faculty of Native Studies at the University of Alberta."Lost Harvests is a work of critical history that should withstand the blasts of even the most artful anti-critical criticism and, therefore, serve as an enduring model for anyone seeking a realistic approach to native policy in Canada." D.N. Sprague, Manitoba History<br><br>"This tight, informative work will blow apart many misconceptions about the involvement of natives in agriculture, or rather, the lack of it ... The beauty of Carter's work is that one tends to forget the statistics -- though the numbers are provided -- and focus on the story of a people who tried, against all obstacles, to live off the land that belonged to them." Sarath Peiris, Saskatoon Star-Phoenix<br><br>"Sarah Carter takes a long, hard look at Canada's policies and native responses over the past century as they apply to western agricultural development. Her book succeeds in dispelling the myths of indolence and cultural inferiority that pervade attitudes<br><br>"Fascinating ... superb ... beautifully written ... By 1920, as is well-known, the condition of Indians throughout Canada reached a nadir. Carter's splendid work explains only too clearly how this happened." Boyce Richardson, The Beaver<br><br>"Thoroughly researched, lucidly written ... Lost Harvests provides us with a Canadian perspective on Indian policy that has universal significance.

She chairs the history department at Brandeis University.A well-researched but unbalanced study of the interelation of race and labor in American history. Bancroft Prizewinning historian Jones (Brandeis Univ.; The Dispossesed, 1992; Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow, 1985) sets out to explore how and why black and white workers have been treated differently throughout American history, both before and after emancipation. Her study begins with a look at the failed policy of enslaving Indians and the subsequent practice of importing African slaves. Some black slaves in the South won or bought their freedom, but most free blacks found themselves either with few prospects as far as skilled labor was concerned or compelled to work for the same people to whom they had been enslaved. Meanwhile, in the mostly ``free'' North, job competition between free blacks and whites often exploded in violence; immigrants from Ireland and elsewhere would destroy black property and assault African-Americans who they felt were vying for their jobs. This is one of the primary paradoxes that Jones addresses: White Americans in the 19th and 20th centuries could simultaneously view blacks as intellectually and functionally inferior and yet fear that these perceived inferiors could take their jobs. The truth, of course, is that prejudicial hiring practices kept this from happening, even after the passing of civil rights legislation in the 20th century. Unions, while giving lip service to brotherhood and equality, were likewise discriminatory toward racial minorities. Disappointingly, Jones devotes much of the book to the period from early settlements up to the Civil War. The discussion of work-related discrimination in the 20th century, by contrast, seems too terse and insufficiently detailed. For instance, the fate of the laws meant to enforce equal opportunity and affirmative action doesn't get the close attention that it requires. In the end, the subject is probably too large for one volume. Nonetheless, this is a useful and sobering work. (34 b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Julian Treslove, a professionally unspectacular former BBC radio producer, and Sam Finkler, a popular Jewish philosopher, writer and television personality, are old school friends. Despite a prickly relationship and very different lives, they ve never quite lost touch with each other or with their former teacher, Libor Sevcik, a Czech always more concerned with the wider world than with exam results. Now, both Libor and Finkler are recently widowed, and with Treslove, his chequered and unsuccessful record with women rendering him an honorary third widower, they dine at Libor s grand, central London apartment. It s a sweetly painful evening of reminiscence in which all three remove themselves to a time before they had loved and lost; a time before they had fathered children, before the devastation of separations, before they had prized anything greatly enough to fear the loss of it. Better, perhaps, to go through life without knowing happiness at all because that way you have less to mourn? Treslove finds he has tears enough for the unbearable sadness of both his friends losses.And it s that very evening, at exactly 11:30 pm, as Treslove, walking home, hesitates a moment outside the window of the oldest violin dealer in the country, that he is attacked. And after this, his whole sense of who and what he is will slowly and ineluctably change. The Finkler Question is a scorching story of friendship and loss, exclusion and belonging, and of the wisdom and humanity of maturity. Funny, furious, unflinching, this extraordinary novel shows one of our finest writers at his brilliant best.</p><p><strong>Product Description</strong><br><br> <p><b>Winner of the 2010 Man Booker Prize</b></p><p>Julian Treslove, a professionally unspectacular former BBC radio producer, and Sam Finkler, a popular Jewish philosopher, writer, and television personality, are old school friends.

Apart from having had no sleep and having lost my voice giving interviews around the world, I can think of no bad way it has changed. The good is almost incalculable. In practical terms, <i>The Finkler Question</i> has been riding high in the bestselling charts around the English speaking world and will be translated in countries that have never before shown much interest in my work. But the greater good cannot be measured in lists or numbers. The Man Booker prize feels like a vindication of what I do and have done for a quarter of a century, casting a backward light on my earlier novels, introducing and part explaining them to readers who have not read me before.</p> <p>I can best describe what I feel as a profound sensation of relief. From what? The usual: disappointment, frustration, bafflement, and the fear of being forever labelled 'an undervalued writer.' Whatever else, they cannot call me undervalued now.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your talents are largely comic and you've admitted to being ruffled by the lack of respect for comedy among the literary establishment. Do you think most novels lose their footing without a comedic hum? Which novelists do you most admire for their comedy?</p> <p><b>A:</b> Comic is the cruelest word. Yes, I aspire to be funny. Jonathan Safran Foer has just said of me to the <i>L.A. Times</i> that "I don't know a funnier writer alive," and I take that to be a huge compliment. But I don't think of myself as a writer of comic novels, for the reason that comic novel suggests lightness or frolicsomeness, a holiday from the serious, and that's not how I see what I do. That one can be funny and deadly serious doesn't need to be argued, but there are those who think they demean the solemn act of reading when they laugh - Rabelais called them the agelasts - whereas, of course, laughter can be as profound an act of the intelligence as any other response.</p> <p>Ian McEwan once said he hated comic novels: it is like being wrestled to the ground and tickled. I know exactly what he means. But that's not what you get with me. With me it's like being wrestled to the ground and stabbed in the heart.</p> <p>The other reason I'm not comfortable with the term comic novel is that it's redundant. The novel began in comedy (Rabelais, Cervantes) and continues to owe an obligation to it. A novel that doesn't make you laugh at some level, or that doesn't invigorate in a way we associate with comedy, or whose language isn't alive to play and paradox and contradiction, isn't doing its job.</p> <p>For me, some of the novelists who do remember their obligations to comedy are Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad (think <i>The Secret Agent</i>), Henry James (funnier than he's often given credit for), Joseph Roth, Kurt Vonnegut, Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Joseph Heller, Mario Vargas Llosa, Milan Kundera (sometimes), Steve Tesich (I know of no more bitterly funny novel than Karoo), and, if I may return the compliment, Jonathan Safran Foer (Alexander Perchov, the sometime narrator of <i>Everything Is Illuminated</i>, is an inspired comic creation). This is by no means an exhaustive list.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Where do you write? What does the space look and feel like?</p> <p><b>A:</b> I write on a tiny open mezzanine floor in the loft apartment I share with my wife in Soho, London. Steel bookshelves rise from the lower floor and in order to access the top shelves I have to risk my life climbing ladders. Light floods in through large windows and when I look out I see the city of London, St Paul's Cathedral, the Gherkin, and many of the great financial institutions. So the space I occupy is airy, and the world I look out upon is vast. This is the best space I have ever worked in, partly because of the natural light, but also because I don't feel locked away. I have only to raise my eyes to see the busy breathing world. Certainly I have never been so prolific, nor looked forward more to going to my desk.</p> <br><br>The Man Booker Prize Winner 2010, Howard Jacobson was born in Manchester, brought up in Prestwich and was educated at Stand Grammar School in Whitefield, and Downing College, Cambridge, where he studied under F.

Consciousness is man's ability to feel, to know and to detect energy. God manifests as creative energy. God is the Supreme Consciousness, the source of the creative field of energy. Creative energy is God's free and undeserved gift to us. There is no other source of energy than Divine Energy. Since Christians believe they owe their existence to this source, this energy is a participation in the life of the God. Christians may think of creation as the continuous bursting forth of Divine Energy. The Big Bang was an explosion of energy: an explosion of God's love given material form.</p><p>Adrian B.

He grows up frolicking in the meadow, befriending butterflies and screech owls, and learning about the dark fear of all the woodland creatures: man. Over time, Bambi seeks out the wisdom of the prince of deer, a magnificent old stag who walks alone through the paths of the forest. Bambi is torn between his desire to be with his beloved mate, Faline, and his yearning for the knowledge and solitude the prince represents. He is also conflicted about his friend Gobo, who has returned to the forest after a winter living among humans. Gobo behaves unnaturally by strolling through the woods by day when other deer are sleeping, showing no fear of his natural mortal enemy.<p> This 1926 classic has been stretched and squeezed into many forms over the years, but the Felix Salten original should not be missed. With the richer, more highly wrought language of his time, Salten crafts a story layered in meaning, weighty with its message.

For nearly a quarter of a century, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were Hollywood royalty, and their fiery romance&#x2014;often called "the marriage of the century"&#x2014;was the most notorious, publicized, and celebrated love affair of its day.</p><p>For the first time, <em>Vanity Fair</em> contributing editor Sam Kashner and acclaimed biographer Nancy Schoenberger tell the complete story of this larger-than-life couple, showing how their romance and two marriages commanded the attention of the world. Also for the first time, in exclusive access given to the authors, Elizabeth Taylor herself gives never-revealed details and firsthand accounts of her life with Burton. </p><p>Drawing upon brand-new information and interviews&#x2014;and on Burton's private, passionate, and heartbreaking letters to Taylor&#x2014;<em>Furious Love</em> sheds new light on the movies, the sex, the scandal, the fame, the brawls, the booze, the bitter separations, and, of course, the fabled jewels. It offers an intimate glimpse into Elizabeth and Richard's privileged world and their elite circle of friends, among them Princess Grace, Montgomery Clift, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Peter O'Toole, Michael Caine, Marlon Brando, Rex Harrison, Mike Nichols, Laurence Olivier, Robert Kennedy, Tennessee Williams, No�l Coward, John Huston, Ava Gardner, the Rothschilds, Maria Callas, and Aristotle Onassis. It provides an entertaining, eye-opening look at their films, their wildly lucrative reign in Europe and in Hollywood&#x2014;and the price they paid for their extravagant lives.</p><p>Shocking and unsparing in its honesty, <em>Furious Love</em> explores the very public marriage of "Liz and Dick" as well as the private struggles of Elizabeth and Richard, including <em>Le Scandale</em>, their affair on the set of the notorious epic <em>Cleopatra</em> that earned them condemnation from the Vatican; Burton's hardscrabble youth in Wales; the crippling alcoholism that nearly destroyed his career and contributed to his early death; the medical issues that plagued both him and Elizabeth; and the failed aspirations and shame that haunted him throughout their relationship. As Kashner and Schoenberger illuminate the events and choices that shaped this illustrious couple's story, they demonstrate how the legendary pair presaged America's changing attitudes toward sex, marriage, morality, and celebrity.

Pitted against formidable natural forces, he and his team faced unrelenting winds with speeds of up to two hundred miles per hour as well as freezing temperatures and day-long blizzards. They traversed the previously unexplored King George V Land directly south of Australia and collected geological samples and magnetic readings. After accident and illness led to the death of his two teammates, a starving and frostbitten Mawson finished one hundred miles of the return journey alone.<br><br>Mawson kept a detailed journal of his expedition, reprinted here in the popular abridged version from 1930. He puts the reader at the cold, windy scene with vivid descriptions of the men and their sled dogs persevering over rough terrain. Mawson's thoughts upon losing his colleague Lt. Belgrave Ninnis in a deep, snow-covered crevasse in a glacier or while dangling from his own sled in another crevasse while alone and near death convey the dual excitement and danger that accompany his unique expedition. Readers will be swept up in Sir Douglas Mawson's amazing and historic adventures. The over 300 accompanying photographs taken during the Antarctic trip paint a vivid picture of that harsh and extraordinary land.</p><p><strong>Sir Douglas Mawson</strong> was an Australian geologist and Antarctic explorer born in 1882. In 1909, he was among the first party to reach the Magnetic South Pole as a member of Ernest Shackleton&#x2019;s Nimrod Expedition. He manned his own expedition to Antarctica in 1911. He died in 1958 and was given a state funeral in Australia, where he was a national hero.</p><h2>Journey to Justice</h2><p>He's become a household name: Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr., the brilliant orator and legal strategist who captained the Dream Team in the trial of the century. But behind the man the media created is a story of a life spent in the trenches of the American legal system, fighting not for clients as high-profile as O. J. Simpson, but for individuals whose voices are too often silenced. <b>Journey to Justice</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;is an unflinching portrait of Johnnie Cochran and the legal system that he has so profoundly influenced. It will forever change our understanding of what works and what doesn't in America's most noble and troubling institution.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>No one came out of the O.J. Simpson murder trial mess with colors flying higher than the lead defense attorney, Johnnie Cochran, and no book from the key figures in the trial could be expected to shed more light on the successful defense strategy than Cochran&#39;s. Cochran, however, has chosen to write a pious, slippery memoir whose passages on his boyhood in Shreveport, Louisiana, are much more compelling than those on the trial itself. Cochran&#39;s charisma and his preacher&#39;s voice are on display here, as is his bitterness toward Christopher Darden, Robert Shapiro, his ex-wife, and just about anyone else who crossed or disbelieved him during his most famous case.This was the most grativating publicity campaign of my career! Johnnie was excellent to work<br>with and as he (and sometimes I) toured the country, the reaction to him by people was so <br>incredible. And I'm talking African American, white American, all ages, all types. This is a<br>man that people simply want to meet, talk to, and maybe even wrap themselves in his <br>aura. He has more energy than people half his age. He's brilliant, smart and cooperative<br>and so imporant, he's simply passionate about his book. And he truly feels he is on an<br>eternal JOURNEY TO JUSTICE.

She volunteered for French Indochina and arrived there in May 1953, in the middle of the war between French forces and the Vietminh. Galard was stationed in Hanoi and flew on casualty evacuation flights from Pleiku. After January 1954 she was on the flights that evacuated casualties from the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Her first patients were mainly soldiers who suffered from diseases but after mid-March most of them were battle casualties. Sometimes Red Cross planes had to land in the midst of Vietminh artillery barrages.<br><p>On March 27, 1954, when a Red Cross C-47 with Galard aboard tried to land at night on the short runway of Dien Bien Phu, the landing overshot and the plane's left engine was seriously damaged. The mechanics could not repair the plane in the field, so the plane was stranded. At daylight Vietminh artillery destroyed the C-47 and damaged the runway beyond repair. Galard went to a field hospital under command of doctor Paul Grauwin and volunteered her services as a nurse. Although the men of the medical staff were initially apprehensive - she was the only woman in the base - they eventually made accommodations for her. They also arranged a semblance of uniform; camouflage overalls, trousers, basketball shoes, and a t-shirt. Galard did her best in very unsanitary conditions, comforting those about to die and trying to keep up morale in the face of the mounting casualties. Many of the men later complimented her efforts.<br></p><p>On the 29th of April 1954 Genevi�vee de Galard was awarded the Knight's Cross of the L�gion d�Honneur and the Croix de Guerre. It was presented to her by the commander of Dien Bien Phu, General de Castries. The following day, during the celebration of the French Foreign Legion's annual "Camerone", de Galard was made an honorary "Legionnaire de 1�re classe" alongside Lieutenant Colonel Marcel Bigeard, the commander of the 6th Colonial Parachute Battalion. <br></p><p>French troops at Dien Bien Phu finally capitulated on May 7. However, the Vietminh allowed Galard and the medical staff continue to care for their wounded. Galard still refused any kind of cooperation. When some of the Vietminh begun to hoard medical supplies for their own use, she hid some of them under her stretcher bed. On May 24, G�nevieve de Galard was evacuated to French-held Hanoi, partially against her will.<br></p><p>The American press gave her the name " Angel of Dien Bien Phu."

Furthermore, the wistfulness that infuses Crowley&#39;s reading is so in keeping with Trevor&#39;s work. There are elements of comedy and whimsy here, but this novel is mostly about how hatred and revenge during the &#34;Irish troubles&#34; consume possibilities for happiness and familial satisfaction. The imperatives of that conflict all but appropriate the novel&#39;s gentle, young hero, Willy Quinton, giving him only a glimpse of the contentment that should have been his.

Humiliated yourself in a room of your peers, or shamed yourself in front of your massive crush? Ever blown a job interview, frozen during a presentation, acted like a total idiot on a date? Ever said the wrong thing at the wrong time, unable to keep your tongue from flapping out the stupidest words you've ever said in your life, <em>ever</em>? If you are a human being, the answer, of course, is yes. Take heart. You're not alone. This is known as the Self-Inflicted Wound, and every one of us bears a scar. Or several. </p><p> Here, Aisha Tyler, comedian, actress, cohost of CBS's <em>The Talk</em>, star of <em>Archer</em>, and creator of the top-ranked podcast <em>Girl on Guy</em>, serves up a spectacular collection of her own self-inflicted wounds. From almost setting herself on fire, to vomiting on a boy she liked, to getting drunk and sleeping through the SATs, to going into crushing debt to pay for college and then throwing away her degree to become a comedian, Aisha's life has been a series of spectacularly epic fails. And she's got the scars to prove it. Literally.</p><p>Through it all, Aisha's triumphs haven't come in spite of the failures, but <em>because</em> of them. Because with every failure comes a lesson learned, a strength revealed, a fear overcome, or an adventure braved. <em>Self-Inflicted Wounds</em> isn't just about surviving failure. It's about embracing failure&#x2014;pursuing it, even&#x2014;on the winding path to success. And after you've failed a time or three, hopefully you'll have learned something. Or at the very least have a really <em>killer</em> story.

The nearest house has crumbled and fallen into the sea. It is Ireland in the late twentieth century.</p> <p>Eamon Redmond is a judge in the Irish High Court. Obsessed all his life by the letter and spirit of the law, he is just beginning to discover how painfully unconnected he is from other human beings. With effortless fluency, Colm Toibin reconstructs the history of Eamon's relationships&#x2014;with his father, his first "girl," his wife, and the children who barely know him. He gives us a family as minutely realized as any of John McGahern's, and he writes about Eamon's affection for the landscape of his childhood on the east coast of Ireland with such skill that the land itself becomes a character. The result is a novel that ensnares us with its emotional intensity and dazzles with its crystalline prose. In <b>The Heather Blazing</b>, Colm Toibin displays once again the gifts that illuminated <b>The South</b>, a book described by Don DeLillo as "a grand achievement," and by John Banville as "a daring imaginative feat...a splendid first novel."<br> </p></p><p><b>Colm T�ib�n</b> was born in Ireland and lives in Dublin. He is one of Ireland's best known journalists. He is the author of <b>The South</b>, winner of the Irish Times/Aer Lingus Prize. In 1995, he was awarded the Academy of Arts and Letters E. M. Forster Prize. He is also the author of <b>The Heather Blazing</b> and <b>The Story of the Night</b>.Scholarly, aloof Eamon Redmond became a judge in Dublin's high court at a relatively young age after a lonely childhood. His meticulously constructed judgments adhere so strictly to the letter of the law that room for appeal is impossible. But what of compassion? Why do his wife and children turn their backs on his decisions? This novel is more a character study than the action-packed tale suggested by the title. The narrative leapfrogs from past to present as Redmond, the motherless boy, plods along with his father, listening to tales of earlier uprisings. His happiest times, as both man and boy, come when he is swimming or walking along the southern Irish coast. When his wife of many years dies and he is truly alone, solitude is no longer the prize he once sought. Toibin ( The South , LJ 7/91) has a subtle way of ensnaring the reader into Redmond's life.

He lives in Brooklyn.*Starred Review* Pekar's autobiographical <i>American Splendor</i> contained glimpses of its author's earliest years during its long run, but the whole story had to wait for this graphic novel written from the vantage of retirement age. As usual in his work, the present-day Pekar appears to comment on the narrative a la George Burns on his and Gracie Allen's TV sitcom, though Pekar emphasizes apology, not wisecracks. Born to Polish Jews in Cleveland months before war broke out in Europe, Pekar had to become a fighter as a small boy and later used fighting for status in high school. He also became a quitter of things he didn't immediately excel at and an avoider of others he thought he couldn't hack. Fortunately, he discovered jazz, and when college and the navy proved impossible for him, encouragement from jazz critic Ira Gitler launched him into jazz commentary, the first of his two major avocations. Friendship with young Robert Crumb revived a boyhood interest in comics, and that jump-started the second. Meanwhile, he settled down to being a lifelong U.S. government file clerk. He still obsesses about being inadequate and unprepared. Ably abetted by gray-toner Lee Loughridge, Dean Haspiel renders Pekar's conception like a more angular, frame-boundary-obeying Will Eisner. Since this is the story of a Jewish immigrants' son, Haspiel's echoes of the greatest graphic novelist of American Jewry are brilliantly appropriate. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The second half he spent in the creation of the mighty roman-fleuve that is <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, memorializing his own dandyism and parvenu hijinks even as he revealed their essential hollowness. Proust begins, of course, at the beginning--with the earliest childhood perceptions and sorrows. Then, over several thousand pages, he retraces the course of his own adolescence and adulthood, democratically dividing his experiences among the narrator and a sprawling cast of characters. Who else has ever decanted life into such ornate, knowing, wrought-iron sentences? Who has subjected love to such merciless microscopy, discriminating between the tiniest variations of desire and self-delusion? Who else has produced a grief-stricken record of time's erosion that can also make you laugh for entire pages?

He also considers newly emerging voices of previously marginalized groups such as women, the working class, people of color, gay men, and lesbians to explore the marginalized and de-centered notions of masculinity and the political processes and dynamics that have enabled this marginalization to occur.</p><p>A collection of historical articles and essays by a pioneer in the field of masculinity studies.<p>Michael S.

It is Luther&#39;s response to Desiderius Erasmus&#39; Diatribe on Free Will, written in his direct and unique style, combining deep spirituality with humor.Martin Luther (10 November 1483 &#x2013; 18 February 1546) initiated the Protestant Reformation. As a priest and theology professor, he confronted indulgence salesman Johann Tetzel with his The Ninety-Five Theses in 1517. Luther strongly disputed their claim that freedom from God's punishment of sin could be purchased with money. His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the emperor. Martin Luther taught that salvation is not from good works, but a free gift of God, received only by grace through faith in Jesus as redeemer from sin. His theology challenged the authority of the pope of the Roman Catholic Church by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood. Those who identify with Luther's teachings are called Lutherans. His translation of the Bible into the language of the people (instead of Latin) made it more accessible, causing a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the translation into English of the King James Bible. His hymns inspired the development of singing in churches. His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage, allowing Protestant priests to marry. In his later years, Luther became strongly anti-Judaic, writing that Jewish homes should be destroyed, their synagogues burned, money confiscated and liberty curtailed. These statements have made Luther a controversial figure among many historians and religious scholars.</p><h2>The Campaign of the Century: Upton Sinclair&#39;s Race for Governor of California and the Birth of Media Politics</h2><p>A blow-by-blow account of the author of The Jungle&#39;s 1934 bid for governor of California describes the mudslinging campaign waged against him and how it was a precursor to today&#39;s media politics. 20,000 first printing.

There were other farm engines in use earlier, notably the plough and crude harvesters, but the purist would say that gas traction engines for farm tractors were made in large scale only in about 1901, giving rise to one of the most incredible enthusiast interests enjoyed: the history of international farm tractors.

The Mystical Theology, is the classic treatise on the Via Negativa, which describes the ascent of the human soul to God, through a condition of unknowing, culminating in the silence of the Divine Darkness. The Celestial Hierarchies describes the angelic choirs, in whose providential care all created things dwell. Through the threefold process of purgation, illumination and perfective-union, the angelic intelligences assist the soul in making this ascent to God. How God may be known and spoken of, how the finite might approach the Infinite, how all created things come forth from the One Source - these were the deepest theological subjects treated in the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, and his expositions earned him the close attention and veneration of generations of mystics and theologians. It is hardly possible says Evelyn Underhill to underestimate the influence of this Father of Christian Mysticism. St Deonise saith was sufficient authority in itself. Included in this new edition are the first English translation of The Mystical Theology, made by the author of The Cloud of Unknowing, and the Latin versions, upon which it was based. The translation is entitled Deonise Hid Diuinite (Hid translates the Latin mystica, and Diuinite or Divinite refers not only to Godhead, but also the study of the nature and attributes of God). The influence Dionysius had on mystics of the Western tradition is also indicated by a selection of quotations in the remaining appendices.</p><p></p><h2>Prayers That Avail Much for Kids: Short and Simple Prayers Packed With the Power of God&#39;s Word</h2><p>Teach your children to pray effectively right from the start.

Corpus Christi Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, the Lydia Ann Ship Channel and the Corpus Christi Ship Channel make up the surrounding waters. Fascinating reminiscences of a fishing pioneer.</p><p></p><h2>Death and Justice: An Expose of Oklahoma&#39;s Death Row Machine</h2><p><p><em>Controversy rages about capital punishment as innocent men and women are being released from death rows all over the country. Into the debate steps Mark Fuhrman, America's most famous detective, and no stranger to controversy himself.</em></p><p>Are innocent people being executed? Are death penalty cases being investigated and tried as if someone's life depended on it? Is capital punishment justice or revenge?</p><p>Fuhrman seeks to answer these questions by investigating the death penalty in Oklahoma, a place where a "hang 'em high" attitude of cowboy justice resulted in twenty-one executions in 2001, more than in any other state in the nation. The majority of these death penalty cases came from one jurisdiction, Oklahoma County, where legendary district attorney Bob Macy bragged about sending more people to death row than any other prosecutor, and police chemist Joyce Gilchrist was eventually fired for mismanaging the crime lab. These two figures loom large in Fuhrman's investigation. </p><p>Examining police records, trial transcripts, and appellate decisions, and conducting hundreds of interviews, Fuhrman focuses his considerable investigative skills on more than a dozen of the most controversial Oklahoma death penalty cases, including two in which innocent men nearly lost their lives.</p><p>When he began <em>Death and Justice,</em> Mark Fuhrman was a firm believer in the death penalty. What he saw in Oklahoma changed his mind. It may change yours.</p></p><p><p>Retired LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Murder in Brentwood</em>, <em>Murder in Greenwich</em>, <em>Murder in Spokane</em>, and <em>Death and Justice</em>. He lives in Idaho.</p>Former LAPD detective Fuhrman (Murder in Brentwood and Murder in Spokane) may not be an elegant stylist, but his latest book is a serious and alarming investigation of legal misconduct on a massive scale. In 2001, Oklahoma executed 21 death row inmates-more than any other state in the country-and 13 had been convicted by the same Oklahoma County district attorney, Bob Macy. Fuhrman sets the stage: A barrel-chested cowboy whose good-ol'-boy brand of frontier politics and hard-line stance on the death penalty earned him a handful of enemies but many more powerful friends, Macy aggressively pushed for the death penalty in cases that other prosecutors would likely never have brought to trial. And his political influence and tearfully delivered closing arguments led to victory more often than not. Supporting Macy in his self-righteous campaign against crime was Joyce Gilchrist, director of the Oklahoma City Police Department crime lab. Often scolded for indiscretions but never strongly questioned, Gilchrist, Fuhrman explains, flagrantly mismanaged the crime lab for nearly two decades and routinely gave false and misleading testimony under oath (testimony that led to several death penalty convictions). When the cumulative effects of Gilchrist's incompetence and a federal investigation finally threatened to erupt into a national scandal, potentially damaging evidence against her was found to be either conveniently missing or prematurely destroyed. Fuhrman stops short of calling Oklahoma's problems a conspiracy, but he does show that they are endemic not only to Oklahoma but also to our entire criminal justice system. While his discussions of the ethical complexities of executions are unsophisticated, Fuhrman's book makes for an engrossing read.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Plato, Not Prozac! Applying Philosophy to Everyday Problems</h2><p><p>There was a time when philosophy meant something to ordinary people and philosophers' ideas were put to good use. Socrates spent his days debating vital issues in the marketplace, and Lao Tzu applied his own advice on following the subtle path to personal happiness and social harmony. Now, as a new millennium dawns, a unique movement called Philosophical Counseling has emerged to return philosophy to its classical roots by combining wisdom and practice to help people solve their most common everyday problems. Call it therapy for the sane. As the leading proponent of this field, philosopher Lou Marinoff, Ph.D., shows us that the road to a successful, fulfilling life begins with a simple choice: <em>Plato, Not Procac!</em></p> <p> When people come to see Dr. Marinoff they do not get endless discussions about their childhoods, quick prescriptions for antidepressants, or tedious analyses of their behavior patterns. Instead they learn how the ideas of the world's greatest thinkers can shed light on the way they live, from Kierkegaard's thoughts on coping with death and Kant's theory of obligation to the <em>I Ching's </em> guidelines on adapting to change and Aristotle's advice to pursue reason and moderation. Dr. Marinoff brings philosophy out of the ivory tower and directly into our lives and the dilemmas we all face. including handling love relationships. living ethically, dealing with career changes, being a good parent, coping with loss, and finding meaning and purpose. </p><p> <em>Plato, Not Prozac! </em> explains how insights from diverse wisdom traditions can be used to help you help yourself to a better life. The issue is not just how you live, but how well you live. With the right philosophy at the right time, you can enhance or regain that wellness. The book is filled with case studies drawn from the experiences of leading philosophical counselors that demonstrate the effectiveness of philosophy in helping people feel better, think better, and live better. Dr. Marinoffs signature five-step PEACE process shows you how to: identify your problem (P), express your emotions constructively (H). analyze your options (A), contemplate a philosophy that helps you choose and live with your best option (C), and renew your personal equilibrium (E).</p><p> A wonderful resource tool, <em>Plato, Not Prozac! </em> also offers an extensive list of philosophical practitioners and organizations as well as a detailed hit parade featuring sixty of the more important and influential philosophers. Dr. Marinoff also gives you a glimpse of the rapid growth of this movement in describing philosophers' caf�s. the coporate philosopher, and other ways in which philosophy--the world's second-oldest profession--is making a global comeback and influencing people everywhere. Intelligent, accessible, and utterly persuasive, <em>Plato, Not Prozac! </em> is a groundbreaking alternative to traditional therapies and an indispensable guide to living a healthy, rewarding life. It's available over the counter; no prescription necessary.</p><p></p><blockquote>"Everyone has a philosophy of life, but few of us have the privilege or leisure to sit around and puzzle out the fine points. We tend to make it up as we go along. Experience is a great teacher, but we also need to reason about our experiences. We need to think critically, looking for patterns and putting everything together into the big picture to make our way through life. Understanding our own philosophy can help prevent, resolve, or manage many problems. Our philosophies can also underlie the problems we experience, so we must evaluate the ideas we hold to craft an outlook that works for us, not against us. You can change what you believe in order to work out a problem, and this book will show you how." <br>-- from <em>Plato, Not Prozac!</em> </blockquote><p></p></p><p>If you're facing a dilemma -- whether it's handling a relationship, living ethically, dealing with a career change, or finding meaning in life -- the world's most important thinkers from centuries past will help guide you toward a solution compatible with your individual beliefs. From Kirkegaard's thoughts on coping with death to the I Ching's guidelines on adapting to change, Plato, Not Prozac! makes philosophy accessible and shows you how to use it to solve your everyday problems.<p>Gone is the need for expensive therapists, medication, and lengthy analysis. Clearly organized by common problems to help you tailor Dr. Lou Marinoff's advice to your own needs, this is an intelligent, effective, and persuasive prescription for self-healing therapy that is giving psychotherapy a run for its money.</p><p>Lou Marinoff, Ph.D., is a philosophy professor at the City College of New York, a pioneer of the philosophical practice movement in North America, and president of the American Philosophical Practitioners Association (AAPA).

There are conquerors, slaves, and rebels from Caribbean history; the &#34;Mayan astronomer&#34; calmly smoking a cigarette in the middle of a New York tenement fire; a nun staging a White House vigil to protest her torture; a man on death row mourning the loss of his books; and even Carmen Miranda.</p><p>Mart�n Espada has received the Shelley Memorial Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. He teaches at the University of Massachusetts&#x2013;Amherst.Espada, a frequent contributor to National Public Radio's various news programs, can keep his magic-inflected tone light even when engaging social disparity: "As I was about/ to put a quarter/ in the parking meter,/ a man walking by/ stopped, whirled,/ fired three karate kicks/ decapitating the meter,/ and stretched out/ his hand/ for the quarter." A former tenant lawyer, Espada makes a convincing Robin Hood both in the poem cursing a "Jim Crow Mexican Restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts Where My Cousin Esteban Was Forbidden to Wait Tables Because He Wears Dreadlocks" and in "The Governor of Puerto Rico Reveals at His Inaugural That He Is the Reincarnation of Ponce de Leon." While these poems make a scene defying their overly deterministic titles, it's the quiet and quick ones that make his sixth collection solid, like the title poem, about a man on a fire escape who stops to smoke a cigarette, or "The Mexican Cabdriver's Poem for His Wife, Who Has Left Him", in which the speaker, having challenged the poets in his cab to write the poem at hand, supplies the somehow heartbreaking information that his wife isn't like the moon but "is like the bridge/ when there is so much traffic/ I have time/ to watch the boats/ on the river." The book ends with a suite of unsatisfying poems about the executions of American political prisoners, but the overall effect of this book is one of poetic uplift in the face of everyday oppression.

His father, a journalist and scholar, has spent his life acquiring them; his mother, by necessity, has spent her life organizing this library. Ciccio feels like an afterthought in his own family, largely left to his own criminal devices. Forbidden to touch any of these books, Ciccio sneaks off with <i>The Golden Bough </i>one day to discover a decades-old letter hidden inside. The letter reveals an illicit affair his father carried on while posted in Nazi-era Berlin, an affair that resulted in the birth of a baby boy.

In the 1990s a group of Native men on the island of Maui responded by refashioning and reasserting their masculine identities in a group called the Hale Mua (the &#x201c;Men&#x2019;s House&#x201d;). As a member and an ethnographer, Ty P. K&#x101;wika Tengan analyzes how the group&#x2019;s mostly middle-aged, middle-class, and mixed-race members assert a warrior masculinity through practices including martial arts, woodcarving, and cultural ceremonies. Some of their practices are heavily influenced by or borrowed from other indigenous Polynesian traditions, including those of the M&#x101;ori. The men of the Hale Mua enact their refashioned identities as they participate in temple rites, protest marches, public lectures, and cultural fairs. <p></p><p>The sharing of personal stories is an integral part of Hale Mua fellowship, and Tengan&#x2019;s account is filled with members&#x2019; first-person narratives. At the same time, Tengan explains how Hale Mua rituals and practices connect to broader projects of cultural revitalization and Hawaiian nationalism. He brings to light the tensions that mark the group&#x2019;s efforts to reclaim indigenous masculinity as they arise in debates over nineteenth-century historical source materials and during political and cultural gatherings held in spaces designated as tourist sites. He explores class status anxieties expressed through the sharing of individual life stories, critiques of the Hale Mua registered by Hawaiian women, and challenges the group received in dialogues with other indigenous Polynesians. <i>Native Men Remade</i> is the fascinating story of how gender, culture, class, and personality intersect as a group of indigenous Hawaiian men work to overcome the dislocations of colonial history.</p></p><p>"This book concerns a distinctive Hawaiian men's movement dedicated to decolonizing male consciousness by means of ritualized physical disciplines modeled after historically resonant warrior images. The writing is powerful; and the point of view is a compelling blend of interpretive humility and analytical forthrightness. Offering a wealth of insider testimony drawn from detailed interviews and from his own engaged experience in Hale Mua, Ty P. K&#x101;wika Tengan makes contemporary Hawaiian struggles and sensibilities accessible to non-Hawaiians by contextualizing them historically, culturally, and comparatively. This work will interest scholars of gender, race, and postcolonial cultures, as well as both academic and non-specialist readers interested in the contemporary Pacific."--Rena Lederman, Princeton University""Native Men Remade" is a tour de force. Ty P. K&#x101;wika Tengan combines participant observation and archival and oral history in a study of the Hale Mua, a group of Hawaiian men who have revived ancient martial arts, carving skills, and rituals. As both member and ethnographer, Tengan engages passionate debates about the 'emasculation' of Hawaiian men by colonialism and tourism, the contested place of men and women in nationalism, and feminist critiques of Hawaiian patriarchy and gender violence. For Hawaiian peoples navigating their future, he suggests there are 'more islands of hope than of despair.'"--Margaret Jolly, Head of the Gender Relations Centre, The Australian National University</p><h2>Joe Deal: Southern California Photographs, 1976-86</h2><p>Joe Deal is the photographer who perhaps best exemplifies the important approach to photographing the man-altered landscape that became known as the "New Topographics" when an exhibit toured and a book of that name was published in 1975. Deal's style is cool and dispassionate, his impeccable prints at first glance understated. But his keen observation and sense of the ironies of the population and building explosion in the Los Angeles Basin make his photographs resonate with the tensions of the human relationship to the landscape that are nowhere more evident than in southern California.<br>Ultimately, Joe Deal's photographs are more than a survey of the urban landscape and vernacular architecture in earthquake country. From the manicured lawns in what were once desert arroyos to cities built on the beach, the sociological implications are profound and never far from view to the careful observer of these photographs. The essays provide thoughtful commentary on the far-reaching questions Joe Deal raises. Presenting these numerous series of photographs together for the first time, this book is a major contribution to late twentieth-century photography.</p><p></p><h2>The Oxford Essential Quotations Dictionary</h2><p>Presents over 7,000 quotations that are organized by topic, and includes an author index.</p><p></p><h2>Ex Machina Book One</h2><p>Award-winning writer Brian K.

His most recent novel, <i>Charitable Body</i>, was published by Scribner in 2012.Crime master Barnard is at his roguish best in the short form as he effortlessly shifts these 17 tales through emotional and narrative gears. The act of murder is viewed through the eyes of a dog; an overabundance of "bliss" leaves a slew of older husbands dead and a merry young widow blessed with multiple inheritances; a randy old soldier who returns from the war to offer comfort to wives and widows gets his during a genteel game of bowls. A lifelong liberal, Barnard takes a special delight in skewering the privileged classes, often by letting driven working women cut a savage swath through legions of dull old boys. Occasionally, Barnard gets a shade gothic: a man imagines the son he never had and pays a steep price for his newfound happiness; a shy, secluded young woman is bartered into a disastrous marriage. Only once does the author stumble, as a violent sexual relationship between two men segues into theft. The wealth of ideas and inventions here might well be hoarded by other authors for a series of novels, but Barnard has such profligate wit and imagination that he can afford to deliver this abundance in a single volume. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shadow Type: Classic Three-Dimensional Lettering</h2><p>Bold, monumental, atmospheric, architectural letters with relief and shadow define great periods of confidence and optimism.

Pat Cadigan's �&#x20ac;&#x153;Don't Mention Madagascar�&#x20ac; and Nnedi Okorafor's �&#x20ac;&#x153;On the Road�&#x20ac; play wittily with reality and identity, and are exquisitely crafted. Maureen McHugh's �&#x20ac;&#x153;Useless Things�&#x20ac; and Ellen Kushner's �&#x20ac;&#x153;Dolce Domum�&#x20ac; are melancholy but no less fascinating. Jeffrey Ford's �&#x20ac;&#x153;The Coral Heart�&#x20ac; nicely tweaks high fantasy tropes, while Peter S. Beagle's �&#x20ac;&#x153;Sleight of Hand�&#x20ac; and Nicola Griffith's �&#x20ac;&#x153;It Takes Two�&#x20ac; examine the nature and power of love from very different angles. The less successful efforts by Elizabeth Bear, Molly Gloss and Paul Di Filippo are still ambitious enough to be worth reading. Only Daniel Abraham's clich�-driven �&#x20ac;&#x153;The Pretender's Tourney�&#x20ac; and Jane Yolen and Adam Stemple's predictable short-short �&#x20ac;&#x153;Mesopotamian Fire�&#x20ac; seem really out of place.

She was deported to Auschwitz where she died on August 19. Who was this woman, author of more than a dozen popular novels and more than thirty short stories, whose posthumous novel, <i>Suite Fran�aise</i>, won France's prestigious Renaudot prize in 2004? Born in Russia to wealthy parents, Ir�ne N�mirovsky immigrated to Paris in 1919. Although she was Jewish, she consorted with authors and politicians on the extreme right, some of whom were openly anti-Semitic. She was sure that these friends would protect her from deportation after the Nazis invaded France. Instead, they abandoned her. Yet she never lost faith in France, even after she was refused French nationality. In this fascinating biography, Jonathan Weiss analyzes the discrepancy between N�mirovsky's real and imagined identities, and explores a literary work that revisits in a unique way Jewish identity, exile, betrayal, and the solidarity of a persecuted people.</p><p>&#x201c;This short critical biography by Weiss, an expert on contemporary French literature, is a fine introduction to her work.&#x201d;&#x2014;Publishers Weekly<br>"...A brief, but intensely thought-provoking biography by Jonathan Weiss..."<br>&#x2014;The San Francisco ChronicleJonathan Weiss is Professor of French Language and Literature at Colby College.

Chan develops the concept of &#x201c;diaspora moments&#x201d;&#x2014;a series of recurring disjunctions in which migrant temporalities come into tension with local, national, and global ones&#x2014;to map the multiple historical geographies in which the Chinese homeland and diaspora emerge. Chan describes several distinct moments, including the lifting of the Qing emigration ban in 1893, intellectual debates in the 1920s and 1930s about whether Chinese emigration constituted colonization and whether Confucianism should be the basis for a modern Chinese identity, as well as the intersection of gender, returns, and Communist campaigns in the 1950s and 1960s. Adopting a transnational frame, Chan narrates Chinese history through a reconceptualization of diaspora to show how mass migration helped establish China as a nation-state within a global system.</p><p>Shelly Chan is Associate Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&#x201c;This cutting-edge book will inspire future studies of transnational history. Highly recommended.&#x201d; (G. Li <i>Choice</i> 2018-09-01)<br><br>"Building on approaches from postcolonial, literary, and cultural studies to criticize the nation-state and linear time, the book is really multiple books in one. At its heart lies the reconceptualization of diaspora . . . <i>Diaspora&#x2019;s Homeland </i>sets out to raise new questions by bringing together three separate fields and in this, it certainly succeeds. . . . The book is based on meticulous research, including a wealth of multi-archival primary sources. In sum, the book not only offers a sweeping birds-eye view of modern Chinese history from a new perspective, but it also provides solid in-depth research on some less explored topics." (Els van Dongen <i>Journal of Social History</i> 2020-01-01)<br><br>"In this elegantly wrought and eloquently argued book, Chan revisits a familiar story&#x2014;the emigration of an estimated twenty million Chinese in the century from 1840 to 1940&#x2014;with fresh eyes, making the argument that the idea of China as a homeland and its emigrants as a diaspora were mutually constitutive. . . . Chan&#x2019;s provocative framing of 'diaspora time' forces us also to rethink national time." (Denise Y. Ho <i>The Journal of Asian Studies</i> 2018-12-06)<br><br>"Shelly Chan proposes an inspired, new approach to the study of migration and diasporas in her recent book. Rather than asking what impact migrants had on their overseas communities, she sets out to examine how mass emigration changed China. . . . Smart analysis and lucid prose pepper the book. Chan brilliantly demonstrates how rethinking diaspora studies has the potential to cut across the fields of modern Chinese history, overseas Chinese studies, and Asian American studies, which have too often remained only distant relations. Her work joins the best examples of recent transnational scholarship destined to have a major impact on reconfiguring these fields." (Michelle T. King <i>Canadian Journal of History</i> 2018-12-17)<br><br>"<i>Diaspora's Homeland</i> is a thoroughly enjoyable read . . .&nbsp;written in a crisp, clear, and entertaining way, free of jargon and convoluted expressions. . . .&nbsp;Geography undergraduates will find this book helpful for understanding how historical geography is constitutive of our transnational present, while its analytical method, conceptual claims, and empirical details will engage and stimulate postgraduates and scholars." (Kean Fan Lim <i>Journal of Historical Geography</i> 2019-02-10)<br><br>"With its innovative conceptualization, meticulous research and insightful narratives, <i>Diaspora&#x2019;s Homeland</i> is a must-read for those who are interested in the study of both Chinese and global diasporas. It is also an excellent textbook for China-related graduate courses in the disciplines of history, political science and international studies." (Sheng Ding <i>The China Quarterly</i> 2019-03-01)<br><br>"The book&#x2019;s greatest strength is its temporal and spatial vision. Shelly Chan castes aside traditional watersheds, offering instead unexpected juxtapositions and a unique chronology. . . . Chan masterfully rewrites the history of China and the overseas Chinese experience, contributing what will no doubt be the theoretically inspiring and highly cited concepts of diaspora time and diaspora moments." (Phillip B. Guingona <i>Postcolonial Text</i> 2018-12-01)<br><br>"<i>Diaspora&#x2019;s Homeland</i> makes its greatest contribution in arguing for a migration history that is unbounded by standard periodizations and national boundaries, opening a conversation that other scholars can consider and engage."&nbsp; (Meredith Oyen <i>American Historical Review</i> 2019-04-01)<br><br>"Shelly Chan&#x2019;s memorable work will be required reading for scholars of modern Chinese history and historians of the Chinese diaspora, and will have great appeal beyond these broad fields. Written in a clear and accessible way, it also would be a book well suited for advanced undergraduate history and Asian-American studies courses." (Fredy Gonz�lez <i>Journal of Chinese Studies</i> 2019-01-01)<br><br>"<i>Diaspora&#x2019;s Homeland</i> is a groundbreaking study that will surely establish Chan as one of the leading specialists in the field. Her interdisciplinary approach and broad theoretical contribution make the book a critical reference for scholars in various disciplines. The light that it sheds on contemporary issues about China&#x2019;s rise renders it useful for policy makers and the general public alike."

And they were usually half the age of their opponents&#x2014;whom they thrashed soundly with almost monotonous regularity. This is the story of Ney, Murat, Soult, Davout, Bernadotte, Massena, Lannes, Marmont, and Augereau. It took, for instance, only 23 days for the entire Prussian army to be defeated and one of the French marshals, Augereau, had the pleasure of taking prisoner the feared Prussian Guards, a regiment he had deserted 20 years earlier in order to become a dancing master.

she asked her youngest nephew, Chandler, as he burrowed out from underneath her.<br><br> &#x201c;That was awesome!&nbsp; Let&#x2019;s go again!&#x201d;&nbsp; He grabbed her hand as she struggled to her feet.&nbsp; A chunk of snow had wormed its way up her parka and into the small of her back.&nbsp; Fina looped the rope attached to the toboggan around her free wrist and struggled to fish the snow out.&nbsp; Some had already melted and was making a cold, wet trail down her butt.&nbsp; She was having fun, moving into the hot and cold sweaty phase that marked any good sledding excursion.<br><br> At the top of the hill, her brothers Scotty and Matthew were prepping for another run.&nbsp; Scotty had his middle son tucked between his legs.&nbsp; Matthew was lying chest down on the sled, head first.&nbsp; Scotty&#x2019;s eldest son was lying on top of him in the same position.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to allow that?&#x201d; Fina asked Scotty.&nbsp; &#x201c;Patty would not approve.&#x201d;&nbsp; Scotty&#x2019;s wife had married into the Ludlow family, thereby rendering her the rare voice of reason.&nbsp; Patty had opted to stay home with their niece, Haley.<br><br> &#x201c;She won&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Scotty said.<br><br> &#x201c;Not until you call her from the ER,&#x201d; Fina commented.&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you guys bring any business cards?&nbsp; There must be a market for sledding-related lawsuits.&#x201d;&nbsp; Her brothers grinned.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t spoil our fun,&#x201d; Matthew said, pushing off, his nephew clinging to his back like a tortoise&#x2019;s shell.<br><br> It was the rare day that the Ludlows had a couple of free hours together, when the demands of the family firm, Ludlow and Associates, didn&#x2019;t take priority.&nbsp; Winter had been a bitch so far, dumping snow and caking ice on every surface, prompting the governor to close down government offices and delay court business for days.&nbsp; Fina&#x2019;s father, Carl, had grumbled about the loss of billable hours, but his children and grandchildren were happy to have a brief reprieve from the daily grind.&nbsp; <br><br> Fina sat down behind Chandler and shoved off the icy surface and over the crest of the hill.&nbsp; Their ride was fast and bumpy, the boy hollering all the way down.&nbsp; As they approached the bottom of the hill, Fina tipped to the side; rather than let the ride peter out, they rolled over and off the sled in a dramatic wipeout.&nbsp; Chandler was elated.&nbsp; <br><br> Fina was cleaning snow out of her boot laces when her phone rang from the inner pocket of her parka.&nbsp; If she were in a different line of work she might ignore the call, but as a private investigator, she never knew who might be on the other end of the line.&nbsp; Fina had to welcome every potential job and every potential lead, even if nine times out of ten it was a telemarketer trying to sell her aluminum siding.<br><br> &#x201c;Fina Ludlow,&#x201d; she said, wiping at her runny nose.&nbsp; She listened to the caller for a few moments before hanging up.<br><br> The reprieve was over.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although most of Fina&#x2019;s cases came through Ludlow and Associates, she didn&#x2019;t have a dedicated space at the firm.&nbsp; She used conference rooms and empty offices on the premises as needed, but she preferred to meet clients&#x2014;especially potential clients&#x2014;on their own turf or at least a turf of their choosing.&nbsp; She learned a lot about people from their environments and how they interacted with them.&nbsp; That&#x2019;s why she was happy to meet her caller from the day before at Mass General Hospital, despite her general dislike of hospitals.<br><br>At the ICU reception desk, she encountered an administrator who could have blocked for the Patriots, so advanced were her skills.<br><br> &#x201c;Who are you here to see?&#x201d;&nbsp; She peered at Fina.<br><br> &#x201c;Liz Barone.&#x201d;&nbsp; That wasn&#x2019;t strictly the truth, but, oh well.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you family?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m her cousin.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br><br> The receptionist printed out an ID badge, which Fina affixed to her jacket.&nbsp; She gave Fina a stern lecture that cell phone use was not allowed and pointed her to a small waiting room.&nbsp; <br><br> The space overlooked an inner courtyard, and although the windows promised natural light, it was nearly impossible to see the sky given the size of the building.&nbsp; Across the courtyard, hallways and rooms were brightly illuminated, offering a montage of hospital life.<br><br> Fina took off her coat, stuffing her gloves and scarf into her pockets before taking a seat in a straight-backed chair.&nbsp; A woman of about forty was lying on a sofa wrapped in a thin blanket.&nbsp; She appeared to be sleeping, but every couple of minutes, she would toss and turn on the unforgiving couch.&nbsp; A Japanese family occupied the chairs opposite Fina.&nbsp; They were deep in conversation, their voices low but insistent.&nbsp; <br><br> Rather than contemplate the personal disasters that had brought her roommates to this place, Fina scanned the landscape across the way.&nbsp; In one room, a man sat up in bed, eating off a tray, his eyes trained on the TV mounted on the wall.&nbsp; A woman sat in a chair next to him, flipping through a magazine.&nbsp; Another room held half a dozen people, their smiling faces amongst a sea of flowers and balloons.&nbsp; Fina pondered the vista offered by the waiting room.&nbsp; It seemed cruel to force devastated family members to gaze upon others&#x2019; more mundane, joyful recoveries. &nbsp;<br><br> Fifteen minutes later, Fina was thoroughly engrossed in a CNN story about national tortilla chip day when a woman entered the room.&nbsp; She was dressed in street clothes rather than medical attire.<br><br> &#x201c;Ms. Ludlow?&#x201d;<br><br> Fina stood and offered her hand.&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes.&nbsp; Are you Mrs. Barone?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Call me Bobbi.&#x201d;&nbsp; Her handshake was firm, but her skin felt dry.&nbsp; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a meeting room that we can use.&#x201d;<br><br> Fina followed her down the hallway, trying not to stare at the occupants of the glass fronted rooms.&nbsp; In some cases, it was difficult to even see the patients amidst the medical equipment.&nbsp; Machines and endless tubes and cords snaked around the beds that seemed as large and as complicated as luxury sedans.&nbsp; Each room boasted a dedicated nursing station right outside its door.&nbsp; The level of care and attention was extraordinary.&nbsp; If you had to be in critical condition, this was the place to do it.&nbsp; In the hallway, a uniformed Boston Police officer sat on a chair, flipping through the <i>Herald</i>.<br><br> Bobbi led her to a small nondescript room with a round table and four chairs.&nbsp; There was a poster on the wall about patients&#x2019; rights and another extolling the virtues of hand washing, but little attempt had been made to decorate or warm up the space.&nbsp; If you were sitting in this room meeting with doctors, the life of your loved one was in serious peril.&nbsp; No one was going to pretend otherwise.<br><br> &#x201c;Do you want some coffee?&nbsp; Water?&#x201d; Bobbi asked. <br><br> &#x201c;No, thank you, but can I get you something?&#x201d;&nbsp; Fina sat down across from her.&nbsp; &#x201c;I should have offered to bring in some food.&nbsp; I know that hospital food can get old fast.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br><br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t felt like eating.&nbsp; This is the most successful diet I&#x2019;ve ever been on.&#x201d;&nbsp; She gave a wan smile.&nbsp; Bobbi Barone looked to be in her sixties with short, dark brown hair, and a complexion that was more olive than fair.&nbsp; She was very attractive, with smooth skin and lovely teeth.&nbsp; Her face was round, but not chubby, and her features were delicate.&nbsp; Fina guessed she was about five feet five inches and carried a bit of extra weight evenly throughout her body.&nbsp; A modest diamond ring and wedding band encircled her left ring finger.<br><br> &#x201c;Is Liz&#x2019;s husband going to join us?&#x201d; Fina asked.<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s getting some coffee, but we can start without him.&#x201d;&nbsp; Bobbi squeezed her hands together as if trying to warm them.&nbsp; The ICU was chilly, which brought to Fina&#x2019;s mind a morgue.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;So what can I do for you?&#x201d; Fina asked, pulling a notebook out of her bag.&nbsp; She had a tablet computer with her, but she still liked pen and paper when conducting interviews.<br><br> Bobbi took a deep breath.&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;ve been reading the papers, but my daughter was attacked a couple of days ago.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I did see that.&#x201d;&nbsp; Fina had only glanced at the item in Friday&#x2019;s paper, but had gone back and read all the coverage after Bobbi called her.&nbsp; Liz Barone, a thirty-eight year old married mother of two, was attacked in her home in Hyde Park.&nbsp; She&#x2019;d suffered a major head injury, and her prognosis was uncertain.&nbsp; &#x201c;How is she?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s in bad shape.&nbsp; She suffered a subdural hematoma,&#x201d; Bobbi gestured toward her head, &#x201c;and there&#x2019;s a lot of bleeding in the brain.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is there anything they can do?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re considering surgery to relieve the pressure, but we&#x2019;ll have to see.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; Fina said.&nbsp; &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Bobbi said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I want to know who did it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;&nbsp; Fina paused.&nbsp; &#x201c;I assume the police are investigating?&#x201d; <br><br> Bobbi nodded.<br><br> &#x201c;Which division is handing the case?&#x201d; Fina asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Major Crimes.&#x201d;<br><br> Fina felt a mixture of relief and dread.&nbsp; Lieutenant Marcy Pitney was the head of major crimes and Fina&#x2019;s sometime nemesis.&nbsp; Detective Cristian Menendez was also a member of the unit.&nbsp; He was Fina&#x2019;s good friend and sometime date.&nbsp; <br><br> &#x201c;Lieutenant Pitney?&#x201d; Fina asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes.&nbsp; Do you know her?&#x201d;&nbsp; Bobbi looked searchingly at Fina.&nbsp; The woman was desperate for a shred of hope.<br><br> &#x201c;I do, and she&#x2019;s an excellent detective, as are her colleagues.&nbsp; I&#x2019;m not sure what I can do for you that they can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to question their skills, but there are only so many hours in the day, and they have so many cases.&nbsp; I want someone who&#x2019;s focused only on Liz.&#x201d;<br><br> Fina had heard this before.&nbsp; Clients generally trusted the police, but they couldn&#x2019;t accept their limited resources in terms of manpower.&nbsp; Like most things, if you were willing to throw money at a problem you got more&#x2014;though not necessarily better&#x2014;results.<br><br> &#x201c;Okay.&nbsp; Well, tell me about your daughter.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s married with two kids and works in a lab at New England University.&#x201d;&nbsp; <br><br> &#x201c;Has anything unusual happened in her life recently?&nbsp; Has anyone threatened her or has she been engaged in any conflict you can think of?&#x201d;<br><br> Bobbi shook her head.&nbsp; &#x201c;The only thing that&#x2019;s different is the lawsuit, but I can&#x2019;t imagine that has anything to do with it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What lawsuit?&#x201d; Fina asked just as the door swung open.&nbsp; A man in faded jeans and a black pullover sweater walked in and dropped down into a chair.&nbsp; He rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands.<br><br> &#x201c;This is Liz&#x2019;s husband,&#x201d; Bobbi said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Jamie Gottlieb.&#x201d;<br><br> Fina extended her hand.&nbsp; &#x201c;Sorry to meet under such difficult circumstances.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I was just telling Fina about the lawsuit,&#x201d; Bobbi explained.&nbsp; <br><br> Jamie made a gesture indicating she should continue.&nbsp; Fina listened and studied him at the same time.&nbsp; <br><br> She&#x2019;d done some preliminary research on Jamie in preparation for the meeting.&nbsp; He was a project manager at a local interactive firm, but most of the information Fina found online was related to his band.&nbsp; Jamie was the guitarist for the group, which had enjoyed modest success in the 90&#x2019;s, but seemed largely inactive these days.&nbsp; They were called Wells Missionary, a name that made no sense to Fina, but was probably an ironic reference to art and the capitalist machinery.&nbsp; Jamie was trim with longish brown hair that dipped down toward his eyes.&nbsp; He wasn&#x2019;t traditionally handsome, but with his square jaw and hazel eyes, he looked slightly tortured, which for some reason was often a draw to the opposite sex.&nbsp; Sitting across from him, Fina could imagine he attracted the ladies when armed with a guitar.&nbsp; <br><br> &#x201c;Liz was working with an attorney,&#x201d; Bobbi continued. &nbsp;&#x201c;She was going to sue New England University.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Fina asked.<br><br> Jamie studied his fingernails.<br><br> &#x201c;She played soccer there when she was a student, and she&#x2019;s developed health problems.&nbsp; She thinks they&#x2019;re related to her time on the team.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What kind of problems?&#x201d;&nbsp; Fina thought she knew what was coming next, but she wanted to hear it from Bobbi.<br><br> &#x201c;Cognitive health issues.&nbsp; MCI to be exact.&#x201d;<br><br> MCI was mild cognitive impairment, the diagnosis most often given to athletes who suffered sports-related concussions.&nbsp; It was the affliction that so many NFL players were contending with, and although mild was part of the name, the impairment could be devastating.&nbsp; <br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m familiar with MCI.&nbsp; What sort of symptoms was she experiencing?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see how this is relevant,&#x201d; Jamie interjected.&nbsp; He bared his teeth in a look between a smile and a grimace.&nbsp; &#x201c;This has nothing to do with her current situation.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that, Jamie,&#x201d; his mother-in-law insisted.<br><br> &#x201c;This is a waste of time, Bobbi.&nbsp; No offense,&#x201d; he said to Fina.<br><br> &#x201c;None taken.&nbsp; What do you think happened?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have no idea, but the world is full of crazy people.&nbsp; Liz didn&#x2019;t have any enemies.&nbsp; This had to have been random.&nbsp; She probably opened the door to the wrong person.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t make any sense, Jamie,&#x201d; Bobbi said.<br><br> &#x201c;I know you want to do whatever you can, but I don&#x2019;t see how hiring her,&#x201d; he gestured at Fina, &#x201c;is going to help.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t expect you to pay for it,&#x201d; Bobbi said, a touch of irritation creeping into her voice.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I meant,&#x201d; Jamie said.<br><br> Fina knew that some people didn&#x2019;t like the idea of an investigator snooping into their lives while some people were more private than others.&nbsp; Then there was the group that &nbsp;actually had something to hide.&nbsp; Fina wondered which category Jamie occupied.<br><br> &#x201c;I want to get back to Liz,&#x201d; he said and rose from his seat.&nbsp; &#x201c;Do what you think is best,&#x201d; he said to his mother-in-law before leaving the room.<br><br> The two women sat in silence for a moment.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Bobbi said.&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re under a lot of stress, and clearly, he doesn&#x2019;t want to hire you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Why is that, do you think?&#x201d;&nbsp; Fina asked.<br><br> Bobbi tipped her head back and studied the ceiling.&nbsp; &#x201c;Jamie tends to take the path of least resistance in life.&nbsp; Right now he doesn&#x2019;t have the energy or the emotional resources to do more than sit by Liz&#x2019;s bedside.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But you do?&nbsp; You still want me to investigate?&#x201d;<br><br> She met Fina&#x2019;s gaze.&nbsp; &#x201c;Absolutely.&nbsp; She&#x2019;s my child.&nbsp; I&#x2019;d do anything for her.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What about Liz&#x2019;s father?&nbsp; Is he in the picture?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My husband died five years ago.&nbsp; Thank God for small favors; this would have killed him.&#x201d;<br><br> Fina stashed her notebook in her bag and pulled out her business card.&nbsp; &#x201c;Do you have an email address?&#x201d;&nbsp; Bobbi nodded.&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send you my rate information, and I&#x2019;ll get started as soon as you say the word,&#x201d; Fina said.<br></p><h2>Armageddon : The Battle for Germany 1944-45</h2><p>One of the greatest military feats during the Second World War was the transformation of the German force&#39;s activities in the weeks following the battles in Holland and the German border, where the Allies had finally inflicted the greatest catastrophes of modern war on them. Somehow the Germans found the strength to halt the Allied advance in its tracks and to prolong the war to 1945. This book is the epic story of those last eight months of the war in northern Europe. &#39;As a military historian Max Hastings has few equals&#39; Times Literary Supplement &#39;Max Hastings now stands in the first rank of writers on modern war&#39; Financial Times</p><p><i>Armageddon</i> is the epic story of the last eight months of World War II in Europe by Max Hastings&#x2013;one of Britain&#x2019;s most highly regarded military historians, whose accounts of past battles John Keegan has described as worthy &#x201c;to stand with that of the best journalists and writers&#x201d; (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>).<br><br>In September 1944, the Allies believed that Hitler&#x2019;s army was beaten, and expected that the war would be over by Christmas. But the disastrous Allied airborne landing in Holland, American setbacks on the German border and in the H�rtgen Forest, together with the bitter Battle of the Bulge, drastically altered that timetable. Hastings tells the story of both the Eastern and Western Fronts, and paints a vivid portrait of the Red Army&#x2019;s onslaught on Hitler&#x2019;s empire. He has searched the archives of the major combatants and interviewed 170 survivors to give us an unprecedented understanding of how the great battles were fought, and of their human impact on American, British, German, and Russian soldiers and civilians. <br><br>Hastings raises provocative questions: Were the Western Allied cause and campaign compromised by a desire to get the Soviets to do most of the fighting? Why were the Russians and Germans more effective soldiers than the Americans and British? Why did the bombing of Germany&#x2019;s cities continue until the last weeks of the war, when it could no longer influence the outcome? Why did the Germans prove more fanatical foes than the Japanese, fighting to the bitter end? This book also contains vivid portraits of Stalin, Churchill, Eisenhower, Montgomery, and the other giants of the struggle. <br><br>The crucial final months of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest global conflict come alive in this rousing and revelatory chronicle.MAX HASTINGS, author of eighteen books, was editor of the Daily Telegraph for almost a decade, then for six years edited the Evening Standard. In his youth he was a foreign correspondent for newspapers and BBC television. He has won many awards for his journalism, particularly his work in the South Atlantic in 1982.

L. Doctorow, a haunting and genre-defying portrait gallery of once-eminent, now half-forgotten New Yorkers buried in the city&#x2019;s largest cemetery<br></b><br>Woodlawn Cemetery is a massive necropolis, four hundred immaculately and privately maintained acres in the north Bronx that serve as the final resting place for three hundred thousand New Yorkers. It is a place of startling serenity and architectural distinction as well as cultural and historical significance that nonetheless remains unknown to the majority of people who live in the city. Which is surprising when one learns that its (very) long-term inhabitants include Herman Melville, Duke Ellington, Robert Moses, Fiorello La Guardia, Miles Davis, and dozens of Gilded Age grandees&#x2014;including Goulds and Astors&#x2014;who were determined to spend eternity with opulence to match their residences while alive. <br><br>Writer Fred Goodman stumbled upon Woodlawn one day when he wandered off his bicycling path. <i>The Secret City</i> is the product of his frankly obsessive researches into the lives of many of the once famed, now forgotten men and women buried there. Featuring nine dramatic episodes, chronologically arranged, each story presents an exceptional individual caught up in a defining or historical moment of New York&#x2019;s social, political, commercial, or artistic life. Readers meet phrenologist and publisher Orson Fowler, ASPCA founder Henry Bergh, Gilded Age railroad magnate Austin Corbin, political satirist Finley Peter Dunne, &#x201c;Boy Mayor&#x201d; John Purroy Mitchel, attorney Francis Garvan, sculptor Attilio Piccirilli, Harlem Renaissance poet Countee Cullen, leftist East Harlem Congressman Vito Marcantonio, and pioneering aviatrix Ruth Nichols.<br><br>Framing and tying together these novelistic tales is the first-person narrative of the author&#x2019;s discovery of Woodlawn and his research. <i>The Secret City</i> is, then, an act of resurrection&#x2014;a way of putting flesh on the anonymous dead, and humanizing and demystifying a city whose fabulous history is, too often, interred with its inhabitants.</p></p><p><p><b>FRED GOODMAN </b>is the author of <i>The Mansion on the Hill: Dylan, Young, Geffen, Springsteen, and the Head-on Collision of Rock and Commerce</i>,<i> </i>which received the Ralph J. Gleason Award for Best Music Book of 1997. He is a former editor of <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and is still a regular contributor to that publication and a variety of others. He lives with his wife and sons in White Plains, New York.</p>1 <br><br>I Call On Herman Melville<br><br>I first glimpsed Woodlawn through the window of a commuter express train. It was just another of the half-dozen Bronx stops I sped past twice each workday, and the concrete platforms and dull green signs of the Woodlawn station indicated nothing more than a disheveled collection of auto body shops, track yards, and overgrown lots framing an old, gray cemetery tucked against the city's northern border. It was, like so much of my native borough, just somewhere settled in some vague past and then left to its inevitable anonymous fade. If I happened to look up from my newspaper, I never gave the place a thought. And I certainly never imagined that some years later, in the wake of that terrible and inconceivable New York September, I would slip my moorings and drift out on the ocean of the city, floating without aim until the currents delivered me up to the ghosts of Woodlawn.<br><br>If I'm to be honest, I should say that I didn't even know I was drifting--just that I was suddenly having trouble sleeping. I live on a quiet street just beyond the fringe of the city these days and I'd never had a problem turning myself off before, even when I had an apartment across the street from the noisiest biker bar in Brooklyn. Back then, it fell to my girlfriend--bloodshot and bleary-eyed--to fill me in the next afternoon about the drag races which had shattered the sleep of everyone else at closing time. She would conjure malevolent chrome and black Harley choppers with glasspack-amplified exhaust systems roaring like rockets on a trajectory straight for either hell or Bay Ridge, whichever came first. For all I knew--blissful, unperturbed log that I was--she was making it up. Lately, however, I'd found myself dozing off earlier and earlier only to awaken at four, or two, or even midnight. The worst were the foggy or rainy nights when the nearby airport rerouted incoming jets right over my house. Then I'd snap awake with a sharp stab of panic at the ominous crescendo of enormous engines which, although actually high above, sounded as if they were about to crash through the roof and obliterate the house.<br><br>Nothing could lull me back to sleep, especially not the late-night news programs on the radio. If I went downstairs to reheat the coffee, just a glance at the day's spent grounds turned my stomach. The next morning on the train, exhausted and frazzled, I read my paper as I'd always done but without real comprehension, the words floating in the air before my red eyes like bits of disembodied ash that could never be put together again. And it wasn't just me. Everyone on the train, in the street, at work, lunch, or even just grabbing a smoke in front of the office buildings, was the same. That is, they were the same as they'd always been but different. Mourning hung like a gray cloud, yes, but it was more: a new uncertainty about things never questioned, a feeling of deep doubt akin to the first time you heard your father tell someone a lie. I don't know what others did, but I soon realized there were evenings when I needn't bother trying to get back to sleep. Instead, I surrendered and took to bicycling through the empty late-night streets of New York City.<br><br>Although my nocturnal sojourns were my own idea, I owed the original impetus for biking to my doctor. He's a nice guy, young and very low-key, and I like him despite the fact that he's conspicuously solemn in the manner of all modern doctors. As a kid I rode the bus with my grandmother for many of her frequent visits to a physician on the Grand Concourse--she had a heart condition--and I remember those appointments as something warm and congenial. After her exams, the doctor, a gray-haired man who favored vibrant silk ties and had a small pencil mustache like the urbane Manhattan gentlemen in Depression-era movies, would sit with her in his office and talk and laugh and share a smoke. Not something you'd want to see in your doctor today, of course. And perhaps as a seven-year-old I couldn't conceive of the approaching end that must have been the reason for all those exams, or decipher the subtle admonitions that I now suspect were the real meat of those seemingly casual conversations.<br><br>The tenor of my own trips to the doctor was all the proof I needed of how much times had changed, in general and for me. Somewhere along the line my annual physical had been magically transformed from the pro forma tests for infections and hernias that comprise back-to-school checkups into something a good deal more adult--and a great deal more anxiety-provoking. No more pencils, no more books: just stress tests, cardiograms, and the myriad nuances of the language of middle-aged blood with its lipids, glycerides, triglycerides, and omegas. "I know it seems a little humiliating," my nice doctor who doesn't smoke said sympathetically while snapping on the plastic glove for my first prostate exam. But I wasn't having any of his condescending crap. "Only one of us endured eight years of college to get to this moment," I shot back testily while exposing my best side, "and it wasn't me."<br><br>Maybe it was the glove, maybe it wasn't. But there's no doubt that there is a moment in midlife when you can feel death probing you and the inescapable fact of mortality finally comes to roost. No matter how good the rest of your day is it's always there when you get home, like the awful next door neighbor who will never move away. That's certainly not the way it is when you are younger, when the people who die are suitably old--like, forty or fifty--or the victim of some rare disease or catastrophic event. Don't misunderstand me: I am grateful for a life blessedly free of such heartaches, for healthy children and a home. Still, you don't have to be as wretched as John Cheever to understand why all those straight-arrows with nice families, big houses, and rewarding jobs suddenly take lovers or get serious about their drinking or waste the better part of their afternoons watching the breeze shake the leaves out beyond their office windows, daydreaming about drifting away from the facts of their lives as lightly as a milkweed seed. But I'm the kind of coward who likes to do all of his running away close to home. So I bought a bicycle.<br><br>Growing up in the Bronx, my brothers and my friends and I all rode Huffys and Royce Unions from the Korvette's on the Boston Post Road--a fancy bike was a Schwinn and usually reserved for an only child or someone whose parents were getting divorced--and I can vividly remember my dad assembling my red and white Japanese three-speed in the living room of our apartment while keeping one eye on the first Nixon-Kennedy debate. When I took up riding again it was an unpleasant surprise to discover six-thousand-dollar bicycles. My childhood recollection is that bicycles were toys and that when you went to a bike shop the only adult was the owner. And it's the same on the roads now: you don't see kids with baseball gloves hanging from the handlebars on their way to the ball field, or hear baseball cards clicking against the spokes--it's middle-aged men and women with heart monitors tricked out any sunny Sunday morning in padded shorts and moisture-wicking socks, heading for Starbucks on expensive hybrids with oversized, prostate-friendly seats.<br><br>Like anyone who gets on a bicycle for the first time in twenty years, I was encouraged by the truism that riding is one of those things you never forget. But my first couple of weeks made me wish I had. They were bad. Real bad. Forget leg strength--I didn't have any--the shock was how winded I became at the first hint of a hill. And not just the big, obvious ones, either, because I made it a point to stay away from those, but the gentle rises you never notice in a car, the modest but steady slope of neighborhood streets normally noticed only by the children who have to walk to and from school every day. When I recall that first week, I don't picture myself on the bicycle. Usually I'm walking. Or kneeling alongside it, fixing a jammed chain, my hands coated in thick, black grease. Still, I stuck it out and was soon proficient enough not to drop the chain whenever I downshifted for a hill. Within a month my wind and endurance were much improved, my rides increasingly ambitious. Another month and I was averaging fifteen to twenty miles with longer rides on the weekends. The gains came faster and faster and soon I was looking to extend my territory like a neighborhood dog. Inspired, I picked up the pace and rode daily. I also changed my diet, giving up meat. When that made me feel even better, I also dropped cheese and whole milk. I had discovered The Brutal Inverse Law of Midlife Fitness: If you want to feel good as a man, you've got to run around like a boy and eat like a girl.<br><br>Before long, it wasn't uncommon for me to ride fifty miles at a clip, and when I tried my hand at centuries, organized hundred-mile rides, I was pleased to discover that, while I certainly wasn't at the front of the pack, I could do them without difficulty. I also began to glimpse another level in the distance: I was meeting bikers who rode more than twenty thousand miles a year over the hilliest routes they could find, athletes training for triathlons, and riders who participated in double centuries--a particularly grueling kind of insanity requiring roughly fourteen hours of nearly nonstop riding over two hundred miles. I wasn't sure how I felt about taking it to the next step.<br><br>Then something unanticipated happened: my satisfaction proved short lived. It was that same feeling you have when you go to bed tired and happy after a hard day only to find yourself suddenly wide awake two hours later, an elusive but profoundly unsettling thought skipping quickly away along the far edge of your consciousness. I was kidding myself--no matter how far I rode, no matter how many sprints I did, it was never going to be enough. I gave up oils, fats, and nuts. Then white flour and white rice. I rode twice a day.<br><br>So I can't just blame my nice doctor who doesn't smoke. He was only doing his job responsi...</p><h2>The Story of the Amulet (The Psammead Series,Virago Modern Classics)</h2><p><p>THE THIRD BOOK IN THE PSAMMEAD TRILOGY, FOLLOWING <i>FIVE CHILDREN AND IT</i> AND <i>THE PHOENIX AND THE CARPET</i></p><p><b>'I love her books, particularly the <i>Five Children and It</i> sequence' Neil Gaiman</b></p><p>At a pet shop near the British Museum, the children discover their old friend the Psammead, caged and miserable.

Nesbit is today recognised as one of the most influential and innovative children's writers that ever lived, and is cited as an inspiration by many contemporary authors, including J. K. Rowling, Neil Gaiman, Jacqueline Wilson, Kate Saunders and Frank Cottrell-Boyce. Even C. S. Lewis acknowledged the debt his Narnia series owed to her work - particularly the Bastable and Psammead trilogies.</p><h2>The World I Left Behind: Pieces of a Past</h2><p>The family was the Brezhnevs, and the author is Luba Brezhneva, niece of the man who led the Soviet Union for eighteen years - but who, in the end, could not protect her.<br>These are the touching and terrifying revelations of a child of both privilege and persecution. The story is of her transformation from a provincial schoolgirl into an outspoken young woman who moved among, and then rebelled against, the elite of Moscow.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: RussianBrezhneva romanticizes herself as an enfant terrible, but readers are likely to consider her merely a spoiled brat. Born in 1943 and raised by her mother and stepfather in the Ukraine, she's the daughter of Leonid Brezhnev's brother, Yakov, who brought her into nomenklatura circles when she became a student in Moscow in 1964. And it's the nomenklaturas' lifestyle that frames her memoirs, an expose of their boozing and womanizing. Brezhneva is also outraged about having been harassed by the KGB, especially after Khrushchev's ouster, which she claims was masterminded by her uncle and her father. As the author tells it, she lived in a spiritual wasteland: her father, corrupted by being "Brezhnev's Brother," became an alcoholic and influence peddler; her aunt Viktoriya, the general secretary's wife, was a materialistic intriguer, their son and daughter hedonists. Leonid, a "decent, caring man," frequently sheds tears over his family in these pages. If much of Brezhneva's story is familiar, it's not without interest as an insider's account.

The same could be said of American political history, especially in the age of George I and George II. There is no better introduction to the radical transformation of Republicanism in the past generation-from patrician to populist, from Northeastern to Southwestern, from pragmatic to ideological-than the radical transformation of Republicanism's current leading family, the Bushes.</p><p></p><p>Grandfather Prescott</p><p>The Bushes began political life as classic establishment Republicans: WASPs who summered in Kennebunkport, educated their children at boarding schools and the Ivy League and claimed family ties to the British royal family (Queen Elizabeth II is the thirteenth cousin of the first President Bush). George W.'s paternal great-grandfather, Samuel P. Bush, was a steel and railroad executive who became the first president of the National Association of Manufacturers and a founding member of the United States Chamber of Commerce. His maternal great-grandfather, George Herbert Walker, was even grander. The cofounder of W. A. Harriman, Wall Street's oldest private investment bank, Walker's stature was summed up by his twin Manhattan addresses: his office at One Wall Street and his home at One Sutton Place. There was certainly muck beneath this brass: both Walker and Bush had their share of Wall Street shenanigans and cozy government deals, but in the age of Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Morgan such things were expected.</p><p>The first family member to hold high political office was George W.'s grandfather, Prescott Bush. Prescott was the very image of a patrician: immensely tall, a gifted athlete and a stickler for proper behavior. Exactly the sort of chap you might expect to find in the marbled corridors of the Senate. At Yale, he excelled at golf, tennis and baseball, sang with the All-Time Whiffenpoof Quartet and joined the college's most exclusive secret society, the Skull and Bones. He married Walker's daughter, Dorothy in 1921, and five years later joined W. A. Harriman, which in the next decade merged into Brown Brothers Harriman.</p><p>Prescott belonged firmly to the progressive wing of the GOP: liberal on domestic policies and internationalist on foreign affairs. He even sent his son George to Andover rather than his own school, St. George's, because he thought it was more modern. His liberalism cost him his first bid for a Senate seat in 1950. During the election campaign a radio broadcaster described him as "the president of the birth-control league." This was a particularly incendiary accusation in Connecticut, which was then one of two states in the country that outlawed the sale of condoms. It also contained a grain of truth: Prescott was a member of Planned Parenthood and a friend of Estelle Griswold, the woman whose legal challenge to the state's ban on contraception later persuaded the Supreme Court to enshrine the right of sexual privacy in <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i> (1965) and thus laid the foundation for <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. Anti-Bush leaflets appeared on every pew in every Catholic church in the state and Prescott was narrowly defeated.</p><p>Prescott eventually made it to the Senate in a special election in 1952 caused by the death of the sitting senator, and stood true to his brand of moderate Republicanism for two terms. He cosponsored the bill that created the Peace Corps and strongly supported civil rights, a higher minimum wage and larger immigration quotas. "Bush Says Tax Burden May Have to Be Bigger," reads one delightful newspaper headline from his Senate years. Prescott beseeched his fellow senators to "have the courage to raise the required revenues by approving whatever levels of taxation may be necessary" to pay the nation's bills for defense, science and education. Shortly after ill health forced Prescott to retire in 1962, he received an honorary law degree from his alma mater, Yale, alongside the young President Kennedy The citation read: "You have served your country well and personified the best in both political parties." For Prescott, partisanship was a dirty word.</p><p>The best linksman on the Hill, he frequently played golf with Eisenhower. A firm believer that "manners makyth man," he once took Joseph McCarthy to one side and lectured him for more than an hour on his boorish behavior. His hostility to the radical Right was as much aesthetic as intellectual. When McCarthy came to Connecticut to address a Republican meeting, Prescott recoiled at the rowdy crowd: "I never saw such a wild bunch of monkeys in any meeting I ever attended." At home he was such a stickler for standards that friends called him the "Ten Commandments Man."</p><p>He insisted that his four sons and many grandsons wear jackets and ties at dinner, even at their summer home in Kennebunkport, and that none of them leave the house on Sunday. Relaxation was of a bracing kind-either hunting or playing sports with alarming enthusiasm. This was to prove a permanent trait, but much else was to change.</p><p></p><p>George H. W. and the move to Texas</p><p>Prescott's son, George Herbert Walker Bush, could easily have followed him into his world of East Coast privilege. He was educated at Andover and Yale, where he outstripped even his father, proving that he possessed a superabundance of character, athleticism and leadership. He married the eligible Barbara Pierce and was showered with offers of jobs on Wall Street when he graduated. A lifetime of lunches in the Partners' Room of Brown Brothers Harriman, with its deep maroon carpeting and dark wood paneling, was his for the asking.</p><p>Yet the young George H. W. was made of sterner stuff. He had joined the navy straight out of school, and had been shot down by the Japanese in 1944 and rescued by an American submarine, making him perhaps the country's youngest war hero. He wanted to make his career on the new American frontier. The day after he graduated from Yale in 1948 George climbed into his red Studebaker and drove to Odessa, West Texas, to take a job with Dresser Industries, which supplied parts for the state's booming oil industry.</p><p>Bush was not exactly turning his back on his powerful family. Prescott Bush sat on the board of Dresser Industries, and warmly recommended his son for a job. Prescott had even given George his new car. All the same, Odessa was a godforsaken town-a scattering of oil jacks and tin-roofed warehouses in the middle of the vast West Texan wilderness. In gracious New Haven George had lived next door to the president of Yale University; in Odessa he and Barbara lived in a shotgun house next door to two prostitutes (a mother-daughter team, no less). But, ugly as it might be, the town was booming. Odessa and its sister city, Midland, sat on top of the largest concentration of oil ever found in the continental United States. The wildcatters and roughnecks who arrived there every day were willing to endure anything-the tornadoes and sandstorms, the distance from civilization, the endless tedium, living in tent cities and chicken coops-in order to make themselves rich.</p><p>The Bushes soon moved from Odessa to Midland, a white-collar town twenty miles down the highway. They were not the only patrician family to seek their fortune in Midland. The town soon boasted Ivy League clubs and posh cocktail parties, and the hyperactive Bushes inevitably became pillars of the local establishment. But for all that, Midland was still an entrepreneurial frontier town. Its population tripled during the 1950s. Yalies and roughnecks worked side by side to carve a living out of the desert. George W. remembers an idyllic existence playing on unpaved streets. By the time the Bushes left for Houston in 1959, George H. W. had made his fortune-and was ready to turn to politics.</p><p>At the time, Republicanism was a minority creed in Texas. This, after all, was the state of Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn, a Democratic stronghold since the Civil War and a place where Republicans were Yankee pirates. "I will never vote for the electors of a party which sent the carpetbagger and the scalawag to the prostrate South with saber and sword to crush the white civilization to the earth," Rayburn, the future Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, once explained. At the turn of the century, O. Henry, then a Texas newspaperman, wrote that "We have only two or three laws, such as against murdering witnesses and being caught stealing horses, and voting the Republican ticket." Up until the late 1950s, the only real politics in Texas revolved around Democratic primaries.</p><p>Yet if Texas was Democratic, it was also deeply conservative. The state is littered with monuments to the Confederate cause, such as a huge statue of Jefferson Davis in the grounds of the University of Texas's Austin campus and another edifice outside the State Capitol unapologetically lauding "those who died for states rights under the Constitution." Michael Lind, a Texas-born author, labels Texas a <i>Herrenvolk</i>, or master-race democracy, where, as he puts it, "the ethnic majority controls the government and uses it to repress ethnic, racial and religious minorities." During the brief period of Reconstruction after the Civil War, some blacks actually held office in the legislature and there was even a Republican speaker. Once the federal troops left in 1876, white Democrats "reclaimed" the state, setting up a minimalist constitution (the legislature meets only once every two years) and repressing blacks. Waco was a breeding ground for the Ku Klux Klan in the early twentieth century.</p><p>There were other things to remind George H. W. that he was no longer in Connecticut. Texans were suspicious of Yankee banks and manufacturing. As one historian, T. R. Fehrenbach, puts it, "the majority of Texans tended to admire or envy a family that owned 100,000 acres more than one that produced two great surgeons, a fine musician or a new theory of relativity" By 1950, landowners were raking in $500 million a year in oil royalties. Most of the Texan ruling class had the mentality of plantation owners: resources, including oil rights, were there to be extracted, immigrant labor was there to be used, power was there to be maintained, money was nothing to be ashamed of and liberalism was to be crushed.</p><p>From this perspective, George H. W.'s timing was propitious. True, his first notable foray into politics was to lose a hotly contested Senate seat to Ralph Yarborough in 1964, but he went on to win a seat in the House of Representatives in 1966. More broadly, his timing coincided with the beginnings of a tumultuous change in Texas politics-a revolution that began while Kennedy was in the White House and was only completed in 2003 when the Republicans finally took control of the statehouse. The first chink of light shone in 1961, when a squabble between Democratic liberals and conservatives for Lyndon Johnson's vacant Senate seat allowed John Tower to become the state's first Republican senator since Reconstruction. Although Texans loyally voted for Johnson in 1964, Barry Goldwater's message plainly struck a chord with local conservatives.</p><p>This switch to the Republicans lasted decades rather than years. In 1964, Democrats had controlled all 31 seats in the state Senate, and all but one in the 150-Strong House. In 1968, the Republicans could count only two state senators and eight members of the House. One of the eight, a twenty-five-year-old from Midland named Tom Craddick, who had been offered the seat by both parties, boldly told a Midland newspaper that the Republicans were the party of the future. In fact, it would take him a decade to win any power in the House (he was eventually given the chairmanship of a committee). Many white Texans chose to stick with conservative Democrats rather than switch parties.</p><p>All the same, Craddick gradually won his bet. In many cases, the catalyst was race. No Democratic presidential candidate has won a majority of the white vote in Texas since Johnson's civil rights act. The burgeoning counterculture and the antiwar protests also alienated white conservatives. (Texas, militaristic as ever, contributed a disproportionate number of troops to Southeast Asia.) Demography was also on the GOP's side. The Democrats' power base was in the old Texas of agriculture and benevolent government, but tenant farmers were being squeezed out by the big estates: between 1930 and 1957, the number of tenants was halved while the average size of farms doubled. Meanwhile, in the new suburbs and corporate office parks, the Republican message of less government, lower taxes and strong families resounded with the new arrivals (at the height of the 1950s oil boom, more than a thousand people moved to Houston every week).</p><p>If the GOP changed Texas politics, Texas also changed the GOP-and the Bush family along with it. Texan Republicanism was very different from Prescott's country club creed: more antigovernment, more populist, more marinated in religion. Prescott had thought that McCarthy had no manners; a group of Texas conservatives sent McCarthy a Cadillac as a wedding present. The question, still debated among Republicans to this day, is: How far did George H. W. embrace this new, brasher creed?</p><p>George H. W. has always had a reputation of being "somewhat to the center of center." Many Texans mistook his East Coast politeness for wimpishness, dismissing him as a "clean-fingernails Republican" or, worse, "the sort of man who steps out of the shower to take a piss," as one of our colleagues was once told. In 1966, Yarborough derided him as a patrician Yankee, asking the oilmen in East Texas whether they were ready to vote for "a carpetbagger from Connecticut who is drilling oil for the Sheik of Kuwait." When George eventually got himself elected to Congress, he made a name as a moderate on cultural issues. Wilbur Mills, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, even nicknamed him "Rubbers" because of his enthusiasm for family planning.</p><p>George H. W. climbed the Republican ladder by taking on the sort of institutional jobs that would have delighted his father-ambassador to the United Nations, party chairman, envoy to China and director of the CIA. In 1980, when he ran for president, he condemned Ronald Reagan's "supply-side" ideas as "voodoo economics"-and he was offered the vice presidency partly as a sop to what remained of the East Coast wing of the party. Despite eight years of loyal service to the Gipper, many conservatives only supported Bush's run for the presidency in 1988 on Reagan's say-so.</p></p><h2>The Big Doctors Book of Home Remedies</h2><p>A book of hundreds of ultra-practical, you can do it treatments from lower back pain to sunburns to wrinkles to headaches and more.</p><p></p><h2>Algonquin cat: A story</h2><p>pp. 133, illustrated endpapers, SIGNED by the author and the illustrator</p><p></p><h2>With Blood and Iron</h2><p>Spine creased, owner&#39;s inscription.

Many are considered classics in the field and remain as important today as they were when they were first published. Until now, however, they have never been available in book form and some have been particularly difficult to find. This collection not only provides access to nearly all of Wilson's most significant work, but also demonstrates the continuity of her thought over time. These essays show that Wilson possesses a keen intelligence, coupled with a fearlessness in tackling the work of early modern philosophers as well as the writing of modern commentators. Many of the pieces collected here respond to philosophical issues of continuing importance.</p><p>The thirty-one essays gathered here deal with some of the best known early philosophers, including Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Spinoza, and Berkeley. As this collection shows, Wilson is a demanding critic. She repeatedly asks whether the philosophers' arguments were adequate to the problems they were trying to solve and whether these arguments remain compelling today. She is not afraid to engage in complex argument but, at the same time, her own writing remains clear and fresh. <i>Ideas and Mechanism</i> is an essential collection of work by one of the leading scholars of our era.</p><p>Originally published in 1999.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.</p></p><p><br> <p>"The work of Margaret Wilson, widely regarded for several decades as the foremost scholar of early modern philosophy, has shaped the field and raised its standards. Her papers are more than required reading; they provoked--and continue to provoke--serious and active engagement.

Come Rope! is a historical novel by the English priest and writer Robert Hugh Benson (1871&#x2013;1914), a convert to Catholicism from Anglicanism. Set in Derbyshire at the time of the Elizabethan persecution of Catholics, when being or harbouring a priest was considered treason and was punishable with death, it tells the story of two young lovers who give up their chance of happiness together, choosing instead to face imprisonment and martyrdom, so that "God's will" may be done. It is perhaps the best known of Benson's novels, and has been reprinted several times.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;How far may one compromise his principles with the State or Society without becoming an apostate?

Patton, grandson of the battlefield genius of World War II, writes that during America&#x2019;s Revolutionary War, what began in 1775 as a New England fad--converting civilian vessels to fast-sailing warships, and defying the Royal Navy&#x2019;s overwhelming firepower to snatch its merchant shipping--became a massive seaborne insurgency that ravaged the British economy and helped to win America&#x2019;s independence. More than two thousand privately owned warships were commissioned by Congress to prey on enemy transports, seize them by force, and sell the cargoes for prize money to be divided among the privateer&#x2019;s officers, crewmen, and owners.<br><br>Patton writes how privateering engaged all levels of Revolutionary life, from the dockyards to the assembly halls; how it gave rise to an often cutthroat network of agents who sold captured goods and sparked wild speculation in purchased shares in privateer ventures, enabling sailors to make more money in a month than they might otherwise earn in a year. <br><br>As one naval historian has observed, &#x201c;The great battles of the American Revolution were fought on land, but independence was won at sea.&#x201d;<br><br>Benjamin Franklin, then serving at his diplomatic post in Paris, secretly encouraged the sale of captured goods in France, a calculated violation of neutrality agreements between France and Britain, in the hopes that the two countries would come to blows and help take the pressure off American fighters.<br><br>Patton writes about those whose aggressive speculation in privateering promoted the war effort: Robert Morris--a financier of the Revolution, signer of the Declaration of Independence, member of the Continental Congress who helped to fund George Washington&#x2019;s army, later tried (and acquitted) for corruption when his deals with foreign merchants and privateers came to light, and emerged from the war as one of America&#x2019;s wealthiest men . . .

Patton lives with his wife and family in Darien, Connecticut.The devil himself has not more cunning than these people.<br><br>&#x2014;John R. Livingston, New York merchant, on dealing with Rhode Island businessmen in 1776<br>Rhode Island deputy governor Darius Sessions might as well have listed John Brown by name when, two months before <i>Gaspee</i> ran aground, he warned the governor that &#x201c;a number of gentlemen of this town&#x201d; were becoming annoyed with &#x201c;a schooner which for some time past has cruised in the Narragansett Bay and much disturbed our navigation.&#x201d;<br><br>Brown, &#x201c;a stormy petrel and bold adventurer,&#x201d; was the most prominent of four brothers who&#x2019;d expanded their late father&#x2019;s Providence-based shipping business into a conglomerate dealing in everything from pig iron to African slaves. Over six feet tall and more than two hundred pounds, his imposing physique was matched by aggressiveness that a year earlier had led him temporarily to quit the family partnership in order to sink all his cash into new ventures, a plan his cautious younger brother, Moses, predicted &#x201c;will sooner or later lose the whole at one throw.&#x201d;<br><br>John&#x2019;s primary venture was, through illicit &#x201c;navigation,&#x201d; dealing West Indian (Caribbean) molasses to New England rum distillers in defiance of trade laws imposed almost forty years earlier to prevent British sugarcane planters from being undersold by the French and Dutch. Like most Rhode Islanders, he&#x2019;d never paid heed to the Molasses Act of 1733 or any other of the assorted Navigation Acts restricting, for the benefit of British producers, colonial trade in everything from lumber to wool hats.<br><br>Founded as a haven for religious tolerance, the colony had &#x201c;a reputation for contraband, quirkiness, and eccentricity.&#x201d; Geography abetted its notoriety as a smugglers&#x2019; paradise. A wedge of coastline without a resource-rich hinterland, its towns dotted like hideouts among the islands and inlets of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island played a hustler&#x2019;s role in the larger New England economy. Many of its most successful entrepreneurs were middlemen, conveying goods from producer to seller, profiting through markups and by keeping costs, namely customs duties, low. Nothing riled them more than government vigilance in limiting trade.<br><br>In neighboring Massachusetts, political protest, though rooted in issues of taxation and government intrusiveness, maintained a veneer of high-toned philosophical argument with Britain&#x2019;s distant rule. Samuel Adams, Boston&#x2019;s most influential revolutionary polemicist at the time, admitted, &#x201c;I get out of my line when I touch upon commerce.&#x201d; Not so John Brown, whose sense of persecution always centered on money. He&#x2019;d rarely complained about the Navigation Acts as long as he could dodge them. But after <i>Gaspee</i> proved too diligent in its patrol of local waters, Brown and his fellow &#x201c;gentlemen of this town&#x201d; petitioned the governor for relief.<br><br>Anger over <i>Gaspee&#x2019;s</i> activities was just one example of the rising and often unreasonable antipathy Americans felt for Britain. Everyone knew Rhode Islanders had been sneaking contraband through Narragansett Bay at a ferocious clip for decades; in some years as much as 80 percent of rum exports from the colony&#x2019;s more than thirty distilleries derived from illicit molasses. <i>Gaspee</i> was merely fulfilling its duty of putting teeth into long-standing trade laws, but that didn&#x2019;t stop locals from harassing its crewmen when they were in port or from calling its zealous young skipper, Lieutenant William Dudingston, &#x201c;a hogstealer and a chickenthief.&#x201d;<br><br>The problem was, authorities long had turned a blind eye to smuggling rather than disturb the healthy percolation of a colonial economy that was employing half the English merchant fleet in the import of huge quantities of English manufactures, especially high-profit luxury goods such as linen, lace, and housewares (called &#x201c;conveniences&#x201d; by increasingly flush American consumers). The &#x201c;salutary neglect&#x201d; with which Britain had treated the colonies was defined by this tacit indulgence of unrestrained commerce. Naval interdiction was minimal. Customs officials were absent, corrupt, or powerless. And judicial procedures were so tangled with red tape and tilted with hometown bias as to make prosecution of scofflaws all but impossible.<br><br>But the rules had begun to change in 1763 when Britain&#x2019;s national debt soared after the Seven Years&#x2019; War (called the French and Indian War by Americans). Strapped for money and deeming the bustling colonies as due to start paying their share of the postwar tax burden, the government revamped its trade laws to more effectively extract revenue from America. In the case of the Sugar Act of 1764, the approach was carrot-and-stick. As an incentive toward compliance the duty on foreign molasses was halved; at the same time, customs offices were reopened, the use of search warrants was expanded, and warships were dispatched to monitor coastal approaches.<br><br>It was too late. Increasingly regarding themselves as Americans rather than dutiful British subjects, people were loath to give up the commercial freedom their government&#x2019;s former indifference had encouraged. Tariffs that in Parliament&#x2019;s viewpoint were fair and indeed rather mild given America&#x2019;s prosperity were greeted by the colonists as tantamount to demanding that each family&#x2019;s firstborn be consigned to the royal treasury.<br><br>Relations turned rancid between merchants and customs officials. Ship seizures doubled between 1771 and 1772. One, <i>Fortune</i>, belonged to Jacob Greene &amp; Company of Coventry, Rhode Island. <i>Gaspee</i> took it in a typically rough shakedown capped with <i>Fortune</i>&#x2019;s skipper, twenty-three- year-old Rufus Greene, a family cousin, getting his skull cracked under a companionway hatch when he resisted.<br><br>Nathanael Greene, Jacob&#x2019;s brother and business partner, railed at the loss of their cargo of rum and sugar. &#x201c;I have devoted almost the whole of time in devising and carrying into execution measures for the recovery of my property and punishing the offender.&#x201d; He vowed to sue Lieutenant Dudingston; not surprisingly, Rhode Island law accorded merchants extraordinary protections against government overreach. But others in the local business community contemplated a more drastic course.<br>The seizure of <i>Fortune</i> sparked an escalating flurry of charges and countercharges. The first salvo was the mildest. &#x201c;I have done nothing but what was my duty,&#x201d; responded Dudingston to the accusation that his conduct was, in the words of Rhode Island governor Joseph Wanton, &#x201c;illegal and unwarrantable.&#x201d; Rhode Island&#x2019;s royal charter conferred autonomy on its General Assembly and its elected governor, surpassing any other American colony. Consequently Wanton&#x2019;s loyalty to the king was by no means a sure thing, a fact known to Admiral John Montagu, commander of the Royal Navy&#x2019;s North American station.<br><br>Montagu called the governor&#x2019;s complaint against the lieutenant &#x201c;insolent&#x201d; and threatened to hang &#x201c;as pirates&#x201d; anyone who obstructed his mission. Wanton retorted that the lieutenant &#x201c;was a pirate himself,&#x201d; whereupon each referred the matter to his higher-up, Montagu to the secretary of state, Wanton to the General Assembly. There, between the plod of diplomatic communication and a mutual desire to avoid further confrontation, it might have languished until the Greenes sued to regain their property. But two actions by the British brought tensions to a flashpoint.<br><br>First, Dudingston sent <i>Fortune</i> and its cargo up the coast to the admiralty court in Boston&#x2014;a violation of Parliamentary law, held dear throughout the colonies, dictating that customs seizures be tried under local (hence favorable) jurisdiction. Dudingston, aware of Rhode Island&#x2019;s rigged legal system, assured the admiral that &#x201c;the inhabitants of this government&#x201d; would gladly sacrifice the captured rum &#x201c;as bait&#x201d; if guarding it through the course of a long trial kept <i>Gaspee</i> in Newport harbor rather than out on patrol. But the move was perfect fodder for political firebrands such as Samuel Adams in their fierce denunciation of Britain&#x2019;s &#x201c;violent infringement of our rights.&#x201d; Montagu supported his lieutenant, however, and in such rude style it was a personal slap at Rhode Island&#x2019;s proudest men.<br><br>He was known to be coarse. (John Adams, shocked by the admiral&#x2019;s public assertion that Mrs. Montagu&#x2019;s backside was &#x201c;so broad that she and I can&#x2019;t sit in a chariot together,&#x201d; called him, &#x201c;brutal, hoggish.&#x201d;) Still, the General Assembly was dismayed to read, in letters presented by Wanton, the admiral&#x2019;s utter rejection of any civil authority over his officers. &#x201c;You have no business with them, and be assured it is not their duty to show you any part of my orders or instructions to them.&#x201d; He warned against sending &#x201c;the sheriff&#x201d; on any such &#x201c;ridiculous errands&#x201d; as trying to arrest Dudingston. The sheriff he had in mind (Rhode Island had one for every county) was John Brown, elected in 1771.<br><br>A few days later a Brown-owned packet (mail) boat heading up the bay defied <i>Gaspee</i>&#x2019;s signal to lower its sails and submit to inspection. The vessel, <i>Hannah</i>, tacked across a submerged sandbar to make its getaway (the same one Brown had hit twelve years earlier), traversing shoals that moments later snagged its pursuer. The jubilant crew then mooned the British goodbye, &#x201c;their faces to the opposite point of the compass from those with whom they were parting.&#x201d; When <i>Hannah</i>&#x2019;s skipper docked at Providence that evening and told his boss about trapping <i>Gaspee</i>, Brown launched phase two of his answer to Montagu.<br><br>Seven hundred of Providence&amp;...</p><h2>John Stott: A Global Ministry : A Biography of the Later Years</h2><p>From his home base at All Souls in London, Stott reached out to embrace a wide number of strategic Christian causes, including Scripture Union, the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (of which InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA is a member movement) and the Evangelical Alliance (with its TEAR Fund) among others.

Not that <i>Wobegon Boy</i> takes place entirely within Mist County. The narrator, John Tollefson, made an early exit from his hometown and has spent the last 20 years managing a college radio station in upstate New York. Here he seems to have put a healthy distance between himself and his Wobegonian past. <p> For the author, John's job is a handy pulpit, allowing him to fulminate against radio, New Age affectation, and campus politicking. Keillor remains a master of the cantankerous one-liner, yet there's a romance here, too--between John and a historian named Alida Freeman. And while Keillor can't resist roping Alida into his own pan-Scandinavian schtick--she's writing a scholarly study of a 19th-century Norwegian neuropath who administered high colonics to Lincoln himself--the love story is genuinely touching and gives the novel an extra emotional ballast. </p><p> So, too, does the magnetic pull of Lake Wobegon. John keeps describing life back in Minnesota as one long exercise in sensory (and emotional) deprivation: "We were not brought up to experience pleasure, so it doesn't register with us, like writing on glass with a pencil. Dullness is our stock-in-trade, dullness honed to its keenest edge." Nonetheless, he returns twice in the course of the novel, and his sojourns among the Lutherans are the source of not only comedy but home truths.</p><p>GARRISON KEILLOR is America&#x2019;s favorite storyteller. For more than 35 years, as the host of <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i>, he has captivated millions of listeners with his weekly News from Lake Wobegon monologues. <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i> is heard on hundreds of public radio stations, as well as America One, the Armed Forces Networks, Sirius Satellite Radio, and via a live audio webcast.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Keillor is also the author of several books and a frequent contributor to national publications including <i>Time, The New Yorker, </i>and <i>National Geographic</i>, in addition to writing his own syndicated column. He has been awarded a National Humanities Medal from the National Endowment of the Humanities. When not touring, he resides in St. Paul, Minnesota.</p></p><h2>Jagdgeschwader 7 &#x2018;Nowotny&#x2019; (Aviation Elite Units)</h2><p><p>When the revolutionary Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter first appeared in the skies over northwest Europe in mid-1944, it represented the greatest challenge to Allied air superiority since the Battle of Britain. The first group to solely fly jet fighters, Jagdgeschwader 7 was formed out of the test unit Kommando Nowotny, and was tasked with taking back command of the skies. Put almost immediately into action, despite fuel shortages, poor training and problems with the jet engine, victories quickly followed against both US and British aircraft, including at least one Mosquito. </p><p>By the end of the war, the Jagdgeschwader had claimed nearly 200 enemy aircraft destroyed in daylight bomber raids during 1945. Fighter aces and those who became jet aces with JG 7 included Heinrich Ehrler (201 victories), Ernst-Wilhelm Reinert (174 victories) and Hans Waldmann (132 victories). This book follows the history of the revolutionary JG 7 unit, examining how their courage, determination and the most advanced aircraft in the world were simply not enough to ensure victory. In the final section of the book Robert Forsyth details how JG 7 eventually became ground down by losses, restricted operating conditions, lack of fuel and overwhelming Allied fighter strength, culminating in final surrender in May 1945, but not without scoring some of the final aerial victories of World War 2.</p></p><p>Robert Forsyth has studied the history and operations of the Luftwaffe for many years.

In the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>All In</i>, military expert Paula Broadwell examines Petraeus's career, his intellectual development as a military officer, and his impact on the U.S. military.<p></p><p>Afforded extensive access by General Petraeus, his mentors, his subordinates, and his longtime friends, Broadwell reported on the front lines of fighting and at the strategic command in Afghanistan to chronicle the experiences of this American general as they were brought to bear in the terrible crucible of war. <i>All In </i>draws on hundreds of hours of exclusive interviews with Petraeus and his top officers and soldiers to tell the inside story of this commander's development and leadership in war.<br><br>When Petraeus assumed command in Afghanistan in July 2010, the conflict looked as bleak as at any moment in America's nine years on the ground there. Petraeus's defining idea&#x2014;counterinsurgency&#x2014;was immediate put to its most difficult test: the hard lessons learned during the surge in Iraq were to be applied in a radically different theater. <i>All In </i>examines the impact in Afghanistan of new counterinsurgency as well as counterterrorism strategies through the commands of several Petraeus prot�g�s.<br><br>Broadwell examines his evolution as a solider from his education at West Point in the wake of Vietnam to his earlier service in Central America, Haiti, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Iraq. <i>All In </i>also documents the general's role in the war in Washington, going behind the scenes of negotiations during policy reviews of the war in Afghanistan in Congress, the Pentagon, and the White House. <br><br>Broadwell ultimately appraises Petraeus's impact on the entire U.S. military: Thanks to this man's influence, the military is better prepared to fight using a comprehensive blend of civil-military activities. As America surveys a decade of untraditional warfare, this much is clear: The career of General David Petraeus profoundly shaped our military and left an indelible mark on its rising leaders.</p></p><p><b>Paula Broadwell</b> has more than a decade of military service and nearly two decades of work in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency.

But in 1994 her idyllic world was ripped apart as Rwanda descended into a bloody genocide. Immaculee&#x2019; family was brutally murdered during a killing spree that lasted three months and claimed the lives of nearly a million Rwandans.Incredibly, Immaculee survived the slaughter. For 91 days, she and seven other women huddled silently together in the cramped bathroom of a local pastor while hundreds of machete-wielding killers hunted for them.It was during those endless hours of unspeakable terror that Immaculee discovered the power of prayer, eventually shedding her fear of death and forging a profound and lasting relationship with God. She emerged from her bathroom hideout having discovered the meaning of truly unconditional love&#x2014; love so strong she was able seek out and forgive her family&#x2019; killers.The triumphant story of this remarkable young woman&#x2019; journey through the darkness of genocide will inspire anyone whose life has been touched by fear, suffering, and loss.</p><p>Immacul�e Ilibagiza lost most of her family during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

She survived by hiding in a Hutu pastor's tiny bathroom with seven other starving women for 91 cramped, terrifying days. This searing firsthand account of Ilibagiza's experience cuts two ways: her description of the evil that was perpetrated, including the brutal murders of her family members, is soul-numbingly devastating, yet the story of her unquenchable faith and connection to God throughout the ordeal uplifts and inspires. Her account of the miracles that protected her is simple and vivid. Her Catholic faith shines through, but the book will speak on a deep level to any person of faith. Ilibagiza's remarkable path to forgiving the perpetrators and releasing her anger is a beacon to others who have suffered injustice. She brings the battlefield between good and evil out of the genocide around her and into her own heart, mind and soul. This book is a precious addition to the literature that tries to make sense of humankind's seemingly bottomless depravity and counterbalancing hope in an all-powerful, loving God. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This was the sixth major battle fought between Union and Confederate troops during a three-month period in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia in the spring of 1862. It was also, effectively, the final battle of what became known as Jackson's Valley Campaign. The campaign, which had begun with a Confederate defeat at the First Battle of Kernstown on March 23, became a showcase for the maneuverability and mobility of Jackson's forces as, heavily outnumbered, they kept the larger Union forces pinned and down and off balance.<br>"Stonewall" Jackson had performed his task of keeping General McDowell's Union forces away from the Peninsula Campaign better than anyone could have expected, and following his final victory at Port Republic he was able to force march his men to join up with Lee at Richmond in time to take part in the Seven Days Battles that saved Richmond for the Confederacy.<br>Jackson became a legend for his actions in the Valley Campaign. His army marched over 600 miles in 48 days to win five major battles. His forces, at no time numbering more than 17,000 men, overwhelmed a combined Union force of 50,000, demonstrating in every case his ability to maneuver his troops into a tactical advantage of at least four to three.</p></p><p><p>Clayton Donnell has had a life-long fascination with the Brialmont forts built at Li�ge and Namur.

Some last days you can prepare for, knowing there will be the start of another cycle waiting with the flicker of a few months off the calendar. And then there are those days that hit hard enough to send the strongest of us cowering for cover.<br><br>That&#x2019;s what my last working day as a New York City Police Department first-�grade detective was like for me. Going in, it never entered my mind my career would end before my shift was through. But I imagine no one ever knows when it&#x2019;s their last day of doing anything. Especially not in my line of work.<br><br>The day began with my usual routine&#x2014;�a two-�hour workout, a cold shower, and two double espressos sipped slowly while I scanned the morning tabloids and overnight police reports. By and large I am a creature of my habits, good ones for the most part, though now and then I&#x2019;ll slip and spend more than I should on a great bottle of wine or play a few more hands of poker despite knowing the cold streak I had been running all night was never destined to warm up.<br><br>By 8:00 a.m., I sat on the front steps of my Greenwich Village brownstone, waiting for my partner, Frank &#x201c;Pearl&#x201d; Monroe, to drive up. The early-�morning sun warmed my face, and it was already starting to feel like one of those New York City August days when the heat-�and-�humidity combo clouded your vision and made you long for a bitter blast of winter.<br><br>By the way, in the event you&#x2019;re wondering how a gold-�shield NYPD salary is enough to land a guy a Greenwich Village brownstone, let me set you straight&#x2014;�it isn&#x2019;t. Not even close to it. My cop salary wouldn&#x2019;t cover the monthly expenses. In my case, you can chalk it up to a little bit of luck and a father with a nose for real estate.<br><br>&#x201c;When you go looking for a house,&#x201d; my dad would tell anyone within earshot, &#x201c;always move toward the cheapest home in the best neighborhood. That&#x2019;s how you end up with a winner.&#x201d;<br><br>My father worked as a lugger down at the old 14th Street meat market. He had been a boxer in his younger days, rising up as far as the number-�three contender for the middleweight title. A broken right hand and a damaged left eardrum forced him to give up any dreams of being a champion. So instead he got up each morning at 2:00 a.m., regardless of weather, put on his white butcher&#x2019;s smock, and walked to the meat market, which by 3:00 a.m. was lit by floodlights, truck headlights, and wood-�burning fires from rusty iron barrels as workers from more than two dozen companies loaded up freezer shipments to be delivered to restaurants throughout the city. This was decades before the area became the super-�chic neighborhood it is today, filled with high-�end boutiques, expensive restaurants, and monthly rents that make your legs buckle.<br><br>My father made good workingman&#x2019;s money, some weeks clearing as much as five hundred dollars when overtime was heavy, and my mom was even better at socking it away. Back then, in the early 1980s, people like my folks could afford to buy themselves a brownstone in the Village, if they played it right, which my parents did and then some.<br><br>The brownstone is a four-�story walk-�up, and for twenty years my aunt Nancy and uncle Aldo rented the top two floors while me, my brother, Jack, and my folks lived in the bottom two. The mortgage got knocked off years ago, and today I still live in those same bottom two floors and rent out the top ones to a retired shoemaker and his wife, still working part-�time at a local bakery. I charge them what they can afford. I&#x2019;d much rather have quiet and steady neighbors than ones with deeper pockets and friends always in need of a place to crash.<br><br>The brownstone has been my home for as long as I can remember, and I imagine it will be until my final days.<br><br>My partner, Pearl, pulled up to the curb, his late-�model fire-�red Mustang as shiny as his shaved head. He had a wide smile on his handsome face, Sam Cooke&#x2019;s smooth, sweet voice belting out through the four speakers. I moved from the stoop and slid into the front seat, and before I had my seatbelt latched Pearl had the Mustang gliding halfway down the street. &#x201c;We still a go?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Checked in with my guy before the sun came up,&#x201d; Pearl said. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s a deal going down, then today&#x2019;s the day for it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d still feel a lot better if we had one of our sources vouch for the guy,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;You worried about him because he&#x2019;s a user?&#x201d; Pearl asked.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s that,&#x201d; I said, nodding. &#x201c;Plus, he&#x2019;s looking to slice considerable time off a jolt that&#x2019;s sure to land him a serious upstate stretch. Under those conditions, a guy like him will say and do anything to get that sentence reduced.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ran his priors,&#x201d; Pearl said, swinging the Mustang toward Sixth Avenue, heading uptown. &#x201c;Every stretch he did, he did for a job on behalf of Rico&#x2019;s crew.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Still doesn&#x2019;t make him an inside guy, Pearl,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s never been in the room when the plans go down. He&#x2019;s a runner. Ready to move when told to move.&#x201d;<br><br>Sixth Avenue was its usual early-�morning slow traffic crawl, and Pearl turned to look at me.<br><br>&#x201c;This ain&#x2019;t the first time you and me made a move off the word of a stoolie we barely knew,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Hell, not even the twenty-�first time. So what makes this particular guy an itch you can&#x2019;t seem to scratch?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing solid,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Just a feeling. A bad vibe. Nothing more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s work off of what we know,&#x201d; Pearl said. &#x201c;The source broke it down from first step to last. He gave us the delivery time, the number of the building and the apartment. He told us who would be in there and how much cocaine they would be cutting up. Minus us having a wire dropped behind their television, we&#x2019;re not going to get a better picture of what to expect than what he gave us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying you&#x2019;re wrong, Pearl. Truth is, you&#x2019;re more than likely on the mark.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re feeling shaky about it, we can hold off. We can take a step back and come at Rico from another direction another time.&#x201d;<br><br>I stared out at the now-�congested streets crammed with people rushing to work. Most of them walked with earbuds solidly in place, either listening to music or getting a morning fix of gossip. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s stick to the plan,&#x201d; I said without turning to look away. &#x201c;No better way to start a morning than to cause Rico and his boys their share of grief.&#x201d;<br><br>One hour later, I was crouched down, my back against a splintered and grimy cement wall, hidden by a stairwell lodged between the third and fourth floors of a dilapidated tenement. My black short-�sleeve T-�shirt was soaked through, the sweat a cocktail of adrenaline mixed with a dose of fear.<br><br>My eyes were slow to adjust to the shadows. I could make out a series of overhead bulbs long since burned out. Blasts of television sound echoed from all sides, a strange brew of Kelly Ripa, ESPN, and Univision. The high volume easily pierced the thin wooden doors that posed as sentries to the neglected railroad apartments.<br><br>Pearl was hunched down to my right, his shaved head and base of his neck dripping wet. &#x201c;Second door on your left,&#x201d; he whispered, gesturing with the gun he held in his right hand. &#x201c;They should be in the room just past the kitchen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How many you figure are in there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eight at the minimum,&#x201d; Pearl said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a best guess. I could be off by one, maybe two.&#x201d;<br><br>I rested the back of my damp head against the cold wall and closed my eyes. I took in a few deep breaths, looking to control my breathing and slow down my heart rate. For any cop, the precious minutes before an anticipated shoot-�out or takedown are both exhilarating and frightening. It is during that brief interlude when thoughts of life and death mingle with images of the unknown that awaits.<br><br>Those are the moments a cop is at his most vulnerable.</p><h2>A Place of Healing:Working With Nature And Soul At The End</h2><p>In this companion volume to Mortally Wounded: Stories of Soul Pain, Death, and Healing palliative care specialist Dr. Michael Kearney demonstrates that while the medical model has undoubted strengths in easing pain, it is limited in its ability to alleviate the psychological and spiritual suffering that often accompanies terminal illness. Complementing physical treatment with such depth approaches as dream-work, poetry, divination, and a revitalized connection with nature, Kearney allows us to begin to integrate scientific and psychological metaphors. Through research and imaginative reconstructions of the mythology and rites of ancient Greek Asklepian healing, Kearney helps us envision a way of recognizing and caring for the soul in its most critical moments. He offers suggestions for workshop activities along with case histories from his own experience. He concludes by proposing a new model for the healing of suffering which draws on the best practices of both the medical and Asklepian traditions.</p><p>Michael Kearney, MD, has spent over twenty-five years working as a physician in end-of-life care. He trained and worked at St. Christopher&#39;s Hospice in London with Dame Cicely Saunders, the founder of the modern hospice movement, as medical director of Our Lady&#39;s Hospice in Dublin, and at McGill University in Montreal. He is currently a medical director of palliative care service at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and an associate medical director at Visiting Nurse and Hospice Care, also in Santa Barbara. He also acts as medical director to the Anam Cara Project for Compassionate Companionship in Life and Death in Bend, Oregon.</p><h2>Cavafy Poems</h2><p>In 2009 Knopf published a new translation of Cavafy's <i>Complete Poems </i>by the brilliant and award-winning writer and scholar Daniel Mendelsohn. Now Mendelsohn has made a selection of the poet's best-loved works for a Pocket Poets edition, including such favorites as "Waiting for the Barbarians," "Ithaca," and "The God Abandons Antony." Whether advising Odysseus as he returns home to Ithaca or portraying a doomed Marc Antony on the eve of his death, Cavafy's poems make the<br>historic profoundly and movingly personal. A towering figure of twentieth-century poetry, Cavafy is a stellar addition to the Everyman Pocket Poets series.</p><p>C. P. CAVAFY (1863-1933) was a Greek poet who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, and worked as a journalist and civil servant. He published 154 poems; dozens more remained incomplete. His fame grew substantially after his death. ABOUT THE TRANSLATOR/EDITOR: Daniel Mendelsohn&#39;s reviews and essays appear regularly in The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, and other publications. His award-winning books include The Elusive Embrace and The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Prix Medicis. He teaches at Bard College.</p><h2>The Long Road of War: A Marine&#39;s Story of Pacific Combat</h2><p>James W. Johnston was a self-confessed small-town youth, who like so many others patriotically stopped what he was doing and enlisted shortly after Pearl Harbor. Johnston chose the Marines, a decision that sent him to years of bloody combat through the Pacific as Allied troops fought their way toward the Japanese home islands. Many did not come back; of those who did, very few have told us what it was like. Johnston tells us directly and honestly, taking us with his First Marine Division through New Guinea, New Britain, Peleliu, and Okinawa.</p><p>James W. Johnston was born in Kentucky and has lived for most of his life in Wauneta, a&nbsp;small town in southwestern Nebraska."Johnston&#x2019;s account is deeply personal. . . . [He] recounts his extensive combat service from the perspective of what he terms a &#x2018;flat-trajectory Marine,&#x2019; that is, one who was constantly exposed to the direct fire of enemy weapons. . . . He brings forth a vivid picture of the ordeal he lived&#x2014;the brutality and terror of close combat, the anger and frustration of watching buddies die in extraordinarily ghastly fashion, the filth and mind-numbing weariness of an infantryman&#x2019;s existence."&#x2014;<i>Marine Corps Gazette</i> (<i>Marine Corps Gazette</i>)</p><h2>Cove, The (Walmart Edition)</h2><p>The hard-charging thriller that launched Catherine Coulter's bestselling FBI series-now in hardcover for the first time. <br><br> Sally St. John Brainerd is on the run from the authorities, who want to question her about her possible involvement in her father's murder. FBI Special Agent James Quinlan goes undercover in the picturesque town of The Cove-home of the World's Greatest Ice Cream-where Sally seeks sanctuary. But The Cove and its elderly residents harbor sinister secrets of their own. After Quinlan and Sally discover two dead bodies, Sally vanishes, and Quinlan turns to his partner Dillon Savich to rescue her from a place where no one should be held. Quinlan discovers she is indeed the key to a murder-but whose murder?</p><p>Catherine Coulter has written a truly suspenseful romance in this story of Sally Brainerd, hiding in a small town from the enemies who killed her father, and FBI agent James Quinlan, who believes she&#39;s the key to the murder he&#39;s trying to solve. Sally thinks she&#39;ll be safe in The Cove--but will she?Catherine Coulter is the author of the New York Times-bestselling FBI thrillers The Cove, The Maze, The Target, The Edge, Riptide, Hemlock Bay, Eleventh Hour, Blindside, Blowout, Point Blank, Double Take, TailSpin, KnockOut, and Whiplash.

He is a novelist as well as a literary critic, essayist and poet, and is widely considered one of the most prominent Kurdish writers by readers in Kurdistan as well as in the Kurdish diaspora; he is one of few contemporary Kurdish writers to be translated into English. He has published nine novels and several collections of essays and poetry.</p><h2>Sitting With Sufis: A Christian Experience of Learning Sufism</h2><p>The sequel to A Baptist Among the Jews is another spiritual journey, this time into the Sufi traditions, including the mysteries of the sema, which is the meditation movement that made Rumi famous. Original.</p><p>Mary Blye Howe&#39;s book, A Baptist Among the Jews, has been featured on television and radio stations across the country. It received a starred review from Publisher&#39;s Weekly and the &#34;Reviewer&#39;s Choice&#34; from the Dallas Morning News. A frequent speaker, Mary also serves on the board of the Interfaith Center of Dallas.The Christian author of <i>A Baptist Among the Jews</i> continues her walk through the Abrahamic religious traditions with this spiritual memoir of her introduction to and practice of Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam. Sufism in America is known to many through the poetry of Rumi, and Howe's experience reflects this; she quotes the popular poet frequently as she tells her own story, which begins with a retreat in Texas that introduced her to Sufism's prayers and rituals. Her narrative paints Sufism in lively action, including the whirling ecstatic dance known as <i>sema</i> and the repetitive chanting prayer known as <i>zhikr</i>. Howe says her Christian journey began at a point of "spiritual rigidity" but evolved to make room for ritual and mystery, which she found first in Judaism and subsequently in devotional Sufism. The insights and practices she has learned in these traditions that are related to Christianity serve to deepen and intensify her relationship with God. Those curious about the content, history or structure of Sufism and its many sects will need another book that more specifically addresses Sufi beliefs and practices. However, those seeking to affirm the universalism of core teachings of different religions, and those drawn to the mystical religious path, will welcome this small memoir. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As his length of service stretches from months into years, he continues to wait patiently for the enemy to advance across the desert. Despite, or because of, the fact that they tell him he is perfectly free to leave, he waits for one great and glorious endeavour. Internationally acclaimed since its publication in 1945, The Tartar Steppe is a provocative and frightening tale of hope, longing and the terrible sorcery of the magnificent gesture.</p><p>Often likened to Kafka&#39;s The Castle, The Tartar Steppe is both a scathing critique of military life and a meditation on the human thirst for glory.

Don Draper sat sipping Canadian Club from a coffee mug on Craig Ferguson&#x2019;s late-night talk show. &#x201c;Are you on Twitter?&#x201d; the host asks. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Draper says. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t&#x201d;&#x2014;and here he pauses before pronouncing the distasteful verb&#x2014;&#x201c;tweet.&#x201d; Next question. &#x201c;Do you read a lot of poetry?&#x201d; The ad agency&#x2019;s creative director looks skeptical. Though the hero of Mad Men is seen reading Dante&#x2019;s Inferno in one season of Matthew Weiner&#x2019;s show and heard reciting Frank O&#x2019;Hara in another, the question seems to come from left field. &#x201c;Poetry isn&#x2019;t really celebrated any more in our culture,&#x201d; Don says, to which the other retorts, &#x201c;It can be&#x2014;if you can write in units of 140 keystrokes.&#x201d; Commercial break.<br> <br>The laugh line reveals a shrewd insight into the subject of &#x201c;poetry in the digital age,&#x201d; a panel-discussion perennial. The panelists agree that text messaging and Internet blogs will be seen to have exercised some sort of influence on the practice of poetry, whether on the method of composition or on the style and surface of the writing. And surely we may expect the same of a wildly popular social medium with a formal requirement as stringent as the 140-character limit. (To someone with a streak of mathematical mysticism, the relation of that number to the number of lines in a sonnet is a thing of beauty.) What Twitter offers is ultimate immediacy expressed with ultimate concision. &#x201c;Whatever else Twitter is, it&#x2019;s a literary form,&#x201d; says the novelist Kathryn Schulz, who explains how easy it was for her to get addicted to &#x201c;a genre in which you try to say an informative thing in an interesting way while abiding by its constraint (those famous 140 characters). For people who love that kind of challenge&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s easy to see why writers might be overrepresented among them&#x2014;Twitter has the same allure as gaming.&#x201d; True, the hard-to-shake habit caused its share of problems. Schulz reports a huge &#x201c;distractibility increase&#x201d; and other disturbing symptoms: &#x201c;I have felt my mind get divided into tweet-size chunks.&#x201d; Nevertheless there is a reason that she got hooked on this &#x201c;wide-ranging, intellectually stimulating, big-hearted, super fun&#x201d; activity.1 When, in an early episode of the Netflix production of House of Cards, one Washington journalist disparages a rival as a &#x201c;Twitter twat,&#x201d; you know the word has arrived, and the language itself has changed to accommodate it. There are new terms (&#x201c;hashtag&#x201d;), acronyms (&#x201c;ikr&#x201d; in Detroit means &#x201c;I know right?&#x201d;), shorthand (&#x201c;suttin&#x201d; is &#x201c;something&#x201d; in Boston).2 Television producers love it (&#x201c;Keep those tweets coming!&#x201d;). So does Wall Street: when Twitter went public in 2013, the IPO came off without a hitch, and the stock climbed with the velocity of an over-caffeinated momentum investor eager to turn a quick profit.<br> <br>The desire to make a friend of the new technology is understandable, though it obliges us to overlook some major flaws: the Internet is hell on lining, spacing, italics; line breaks and indentation are often obscured in electronic transmission. The integrity of the poetic line can be a serious casualty. Still, it is fruitless to quarrel with the actuality of change, and difficult to resist it profitably&#x2014;except, perhaps, in private, where we may revel in our physical books and even, if we like, write with pen or pencil on graph paper or type our thoughts with the Smith-Corona manual to which we have a sentimental attachment. One room in the fine &#x201c;Drawn to Language&#x201d; exhibit at the University of Southern California&#x2019;s Fisher Art Museum in September 2013 was devoted to Susan Silton&#x2019;s site-specific installation of a circle of tables on which sat ten manual typewriters of different makes, models, sizes, and decades. It was moving to behold the machines not only as objects of nostalgia in an attractive arrangement but as metonymies of the experience of writing in the twentieth century&#x2014;and as invitations to sit down and hunt and peck away to your heart&#x2019;s content. Seeing the typewriters in that room I felt as I do when the talk touches on the acquisition of an author&#x2019;s papers by a university library. It&#x2019;s odd to be a member of the last generation to have &#x201c;papers&#x201d; in this archival and material sense. Odd for an era to slip into a museum while you watch.<br> <br>You may say&#x2014;I have heard the argument&#x2014;that the one-minute poem is not far off. Twitter&#x2019;s 140-keystroke constraint&#x2014;together with the value placed on being &#x201c;up to speed&#x201d;&#x2014;brings the clock into the game. Poetry, a byte-size kind of poetry, has been, or soon will be, a benefit of attention deficit disorder. (This statement, or prediction, is not necessarily or not always made in disparagement.) Unlike the telephone, the instruments of social media rely on the written, not the spoken word, and it will be interesting to see what happens when the values of hip-hop lyricists and spoken-word poets, for whom the performative aspects of the art are paramount, tangle with the values of concision, bite, and wit consistent with the rules of the Twitter feed. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the sentence I have just composed will be, for all intents and purposes, anachronistic in a couple of years or less. Among my favorite oxymorons is &#x201c;ancient computer,&#x201d; applied to my own desktop.3<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>In his famous and famously controversial Rede Lecture at Cambridge University in 1959, the English novelist C. P. Snow addressed the widening chasm between the two dominant strains in our culture.4 There were the humanists on the one side. On the other were the scientists and applied scientists, the agents of technological change. And &#x201c;a gulf of mutual incomprehension&#x201d; separated them. Though Snow endeavored to appear evenhanded, it became apparent that he favored the sciences&#x2014;he opted, in his terms, for the fact rather than the myth. The scientists &#x201c;have the future in their bones&#x201d;&#x2014;a future that will nourish the hungry, clothe the masses, reduce the risk of infant mortality, cure ailments, and prolong life. And &#x201c;the traditional culture responds by wishing the future did not exist.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Rede Lecture came in the wake of the scare set off by the Soviet Union&#x2019;s launch of Sputnik in October 1957. There was widespread fear that we in the West, and particularly we in the United States, were in danger of falling behind the Russians in the race for space, itself a metaphor for the scientific control of the future. For this reason among others, Snow&#x2019;s lecture was extraordinarily successful. Introducing a phrase into common parlance, &#x201c;The Two Cultures&#x201d; reached great numbers of readers and helped shape a climate friendly to science at the expense of the traditional components of a liberal education. Much in that lecture infuriated the folks on the humanist side of the divide.5 Snow wrote as though humanistic values were possible without humanistic studies. In literature he saw not a corrective or a criticism of life but a threat. He interpreted George Orwell&#x2019;s 1984 as &#x201c;the strongest possible wish that the future should not exist&#x201d; rather than as a warning against the authoritarian impulses of the modern state coupled with its sophistication of surveillance. Snow founded his argument on the unexamined assumption that scientists, in thrall to the truth, can be counted on to do the right thing&#x2014;an assumption that the history of munitions would explode even if we could all agree on what &#x201c;the right thing&#x201d; is. For Snow, who had been knighted and would be granted a life peerage, the future was bound to be an improvement on the past, and the change would be entirely attributable to the people in the white coats in the laboratory. Generalizing from the reactionary political tendencies of certain famous modern writers, Snow floated the suggestion that they&#x2014;and by implication those who read them&#x2014;managed to &#x201c;bring Auschwitz that much nearer.&#x201d; Looking back at the Rede Lecture five years later, Snow saw no reason to modify the view that intellectuals were natural Luddites, prone to &#x201c;talk about a pre-Industrial Eden&#x201d; that never was. They ignored the simple truth that the historian J. H. Plumb stated: &#x201c;No one in his senses would choose to have been born in a previous age unless he could be certain that he would have been born into a prosperous family, that he would have enjoyed extremely good health, and that he could have accepted stoically the death of the majority of his children.&#x201d; In short, according to Snow, the humanists were content to dwell in a &#x201c;pretty-pretty past.&#x201d;<br> <br>In 1962 F. R. Leavis, then perhaps the most influential literary critic at Cambridge, denounced Snow&#x2019;s thesis with such vitriol and contempt that he may have done the humanist side more harm than good. &#x201c;Snow exposes complacently a complete ignorance,&#x201d; Leavis said in the Richmond Lecture, and &#x201c;is as intellectually undistinguished as it is possible to be.&#x201d; Yet, Leavis added, Snow writes in a &#x201c;tone of which one can say that, while only genius could justify it, one cannot readily think of genius adopting it.&#x201d;6 Reread today, the Richmond Lecture may be a classic of invective inviting close study. As rhetoric it was devastating. But as a document in a conflict of ideas, the Richmond Lecture left much to be desired. Leavis did not adequately address the charges that Snow leveled at literature and the arts on social and moral grounds.7 The scandal in personalities, the shrillness of tone, eclipsed the subject of the debate, which got fought out in the letters column of the literary press and was all the talk in the senior common rooms and faculty lounges of the English-speaking world.<br> <br>The controversy ignited by a pair of dueling lectures at Cambridge deserves another look now not only because fifty years have passed and we can better judge what has happened in the intervening period but because more than ever the humanities today stand in need of defense. In universities and liberal arts colleges, these are hard times for the study of ideas. In 2013, front page articles in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal screamed about the crisis in higher education especially in humanist fields: shrinking enrollments at liberal arts colleges; the shutting down of entire college departments; the elimination of courses and requirements once considered vital. The host of &#x201c;worrisome long-trends&#x201d; included &#x201c;a national decline in the number of graduating high-school seniors, a swarm of technologies driving down costs and profit margins, rising student debt, a soft job market for college graduates and stagnant household incomes.&#x201d;8 Is that all? No, and it isn&#x2019;t everything. There has also been a spate of op-ed columns suggesting that students would be wise to save their money, study something that can lead to gainful employment, and forget about majoring in modern dance, art history, philosophy, sociology, theology, or English unless they are independently wealthy.<br> <br>The cornerstones of the humanities, English and history, have taken a beating. At Yale, English was the most popular major in 1972&#x2013;73. It did not make the top five in 2012&#x2013;13. Twenty-one years ago, 216 Yale undergraduates majored in history; less than half that number picked the field last year.9 Harvard&#x2014;where English majors dwindled from 36 percent of the student body in 1954 to 20 percent in 2012&#x2014;has issued a report on the precipitous drop. Russell A. Berman of Stanford, in a piece in The Chronicle of Higher Education ominously entitled &#x201c;Humanist: Heal Thyself,&#x201d; observed that &#x201c;the marginalization of the great works of the erstwhile canon has impoverished the humanities,&#x201d; and that the Harvard report came to this important conclusion. But he noted, too, that it stopped short of calling for a great-books list of required readings. My heart sinks when I read such a piece and arrive at a paragraph in which the topic sentence is, &#x201c;Clearly majoring in the humanities has long been an anomaly for American undergraduates.&#x201d;10 Or is such a sentence&#x2014;constructed as if to sound value-neutral and judgment-free in the proper scientific manner&#x2014;part of the problem? The ability of an educated populace to read critically, to write clearly, to think coherently, and to retain knowledge&#x2014;even the ability to grasp the basic rules of grammar and diction&#x2014;seems to be declining at a pace consonant with the rise of the Internet search engine and the autocorrect function in computer programs.<br> <br>Not merely the cost but the value of a liberal arts education has come into doubt. The humanists find themselves in a bind. Consider the plight of the English department. &#x201c;The folly of studying, say, English Lit has become something of an Internet clich�&#x2014;the stuff of sneering &#x2018;Worst Majors&#x2019; listicles that seem always to be sponsored by personal-finance websites,&#x201d; Thomas Frank writes in Harper&#x2019;s.11 There is a new philistinism afoot, and the daunting price tag of college or graduate education adds an extra wrinkle to an argument of ferocious intensity. &#x201c;The study of literature has traditionally been felt to have a unique effectiveness in opening the mind and illuminating it, in purging the mind of prejudices and received ideas, in making the mind free and active,&#x201d; Lionel Trilling wrote at the time of the Leavis&#x2013;Snow controversy. &#x201c;The classic defense of literary study holds that, from the effect which the study of literature has upon the private sentiments of a student, there results, or can be made to result, an improvement in the intelligence, and especially the intelligence as it touches the moral life.&#x201d;12 It is vastly more difficult today to mount such a defense after three or more decades of sustained assault on canons of judgment, the idea of greatness, the related idea of genius, and the whole vast cavalcade of Western civilization.13 Heather Mac Donald writes more in sorrow than in anger that the once-proud English department at UCLA&#x2014;which even lately could boast of being home to more undergraduate majors than any other department in the nation&#x2014;has dismantled its core, doing away with the formerly obligatory four courses in Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton. You can now satisfy the requirements of an English major with &#x201c;alternative rubrics of gender, sexuality, race, and class.&#x201d; The coup, as Mac Donald terms it, took place in 2011 and is but one event in a pattern of academic changes that would replace a theory of education based on a &#x201c;constant, sophisticated dialogue between past and present&#x201d; with a consumer mind-set based on &#x201c;narcissism, an obsession with victimhood, and a relentless determination to reduce the stunning complexity of the past to the shallow categories of identity and class politics. Sitting atop an entire civilization of aesthetic wonders, the contemporary academic wants only to study oppression, preferably his or her own, defined reductively according to gonads and melanin.&#x201d;</p><h2>Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</h2><p>After returning from World War II, Tom Rath enters the world of corporate business to face the pressures and demands of the rat race</p><p>10 1-hour cassettes"One of the most influential American novels of the 1950s." --David Halberstam <p>"A consequential novel . . . by a mature writer who knows unwaveringly what he is about." --Saturday Review </p><p>"A thoughtful, searching novel." --New York Herald Tribune </p><p>"Masterful." --Detroit News </p><p>"Excellent . . . sure, bright, and alive." --Chicago Tribune </p><p>"Delightful . . . beautifully plotted." --Boston Herald </p><p>"[An] excellent novel." --Kansas City Star </p><p>"Exact in its account of the pressures, problems and tribal customs of the men in gray flannel suits. . . .

He had an adventurous life -- as a baby he was carried by his father to the top of the Old Man of Coniston, a peak that is 2,276 ft high! He went to Russia in 1913 to study folklore and in 1914, at the start of World War I he became a foreign correspondent for the <i>Daily News</i>.

He played chess with Lenin and married Trotsky's personal secretary, Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina. On their return to England, he bought a cottage near Windermere in the Lake District and began writing children's stories. In a 1958 author's note, Ransome wrote: ''I have been often asked how I came to write <i>Swallows and Amazons</i>. The answer is that it had its beginning long, long ago when, as children, my brother, my sisters and I spent most of our holidays on a farm at the south end of Coniston. We played in or on the lake or on the hills above... Going away from it we were half drowned in tears. While away from it, as children and as grown-ups, we dreamt about it. No matter where I was, wandering about the world, I used at night to look for the North Star and, in my mind's eye, could see the beloved sky-line of great hills beneath it. <i>Swallows</i> grew out of those old memories. I could not help writing it. It almost wrote itself.'' He published the first of his children's classics, the 12 S<i>wallows and Amazons</i> books, in 1930.

We&#x2019;d completed our first full week outside in the piazza&#x2014;a relief, let me tell you, after all those stuffy hours performing from the back of the cafe, getting in the way of customers wanting to use the staircase. There was quite a breeze that morning, and our brand-new marquee was flapping all around us, but we were all feeling a little bit brighter and fresher, and I guess it showed in our music.<br><br>But here I am talking like I&#x2019;m a regular band member. Actually, I&#x2019;m one of the &#x201c;gypsies,&#x201d; as the other musicians call us, one of the guys who move around the piazza, helping out whichever of the three cafe orchestras needs us. Mostly I play here at the Caff� Lavena, but on a busy afternoon, I might do a set with the Quadri boys, go over to the Florian, then back across the square to the Lavena. I get on fine with them all&#x2014;and with the waiters too&#x2014;and in any other city I&#x2019;d have a regular position by now. But in this place, so obsessed with tradition and the past, everything&#x2019;s upside down. Anywhere else, being a guitar player would go in a guy&#x2019;s favour. But here? A guitar! The cafe managers get uneasy. It looks too modern, the tourists won&#x2019;t like it. Last autumn I got myself a vintage jazz model with an oval sound-hole, the kind of thing Django Reinhardt might have played, so there was no way anyone would mistake me for a rock-and-roller. That made things a little easier, but the cafe managers, they still don&#x2019;t like it. The truth is, if you&#x2019;re a guitarist, you can be Joe Pass, they still wouldn&#x2019;t give you a regular job in this square.<br><br>There&#x2019;s also, of course, the small matter of my not being Italian, never mind Venetian. It&#x2019;s the same for that big Czech guy with the alto sax. We&#x2019;re well liked, we&#x2019;re needed by the other musicians, but we don&#x2019;t quite fit the official bill. Just play and keep your mouth shut, that&#x2019;s what the cafe managers always say. That way the tourists won&#x2019;t know you&#x2019;re not Italian. Wear your suit, sunglasses, keep the hair combed back, no one will know the difference, just don&#x2019;t start talking.<br><br>But I don&#x2019;t do too bad. All three cafe orchestras, especially when they have to play at the same time from their rival tents, they need a guitar&#x2014;something soft, solid, but amplified, thumping out the chords from the back. I guess you&#x2019;re thinking, three bands playing at the same time in the same square, that would sound like a real mess. But the Piazza San Marco&#x2019;s big enough to take it. A tourist strolling across the square will hear one tune fade out, another fade in, like he&#x2019;s shifting the dial on a radio. What tourists can&#x2019;t take too much of is the classical stuff, all these instrumental versions of famous arias. Okay, this is San Marco, they don&#x2019;t want the latest pop hits. But every few minutes they want something they recognise, maybe an old Julie Andrews number, or the theme from a famous movie. I remember once last summer, going from band to band and playing &#x201c;The Godfather&#x201d; nine times in one afternoon.<br><br>Anyway there we were that spring morning, playing in front of a good crowd of tourists, when I saw Tony Gardner, sitting alone with his coffee, almost directly in front of us, maybe six metres back from our marquee. We get famous people in the square all the time, we never make a fuss. At the end of a number, maybe a quiet word will go around the band members. Look, there&#x2019;s Warren Beatty. Look, it&#x2019;s Kissinger. That woman, she&#x2019;s the one who was in the movie about the men who swap their faces. We&#x2019;re used to it. This is the Piazza San Marco after all. But when I realised it was Tony Gardner sitting there, that was different. I did get excited.<br><br>Tony Gardner had been my mother&#x2019;s favourite. Back home, back in the communist days, it had been really hard to get records like that, but my mother had pretty much his whole collection. Once when I was a boy, I scratched one of those precious records. The apartment was so cramped, and a boy my age, you just had to move around sometimes, especially during those cold months when you couldn&#x2019;t go outside. So I was playing this game jumping from our little sofa to the armchair, and one time I misjudged it and hit the record player. The needle went across the record with a zip&#x2014;this was long before CDs&#x2014;and my mother came in from the kitchen and began shouting at me. I felt so bad, not just because she was shouting at me, but because I knew it was one of Tony Gardner&#x2019;s records, and I knew how much it meant to her. And I knew that this one too would now have those popping noises going through it while he crooned those American songs. Years later, when I was working in Warsaw and I got to know about black-market records, I gave my mother replacements of all her worn-out Tony Gardner albums, including that one I scratched. It took me over three years, but I kept getting them, one by one, and each time I went back to see her I&#x2019;d bring her another.<br><br>So you see why I got so excited when I recognised him, barely six metres away. At first I couldn&#x2019;t quite believe it, and I might have been a beat late with a chord change. Tony Gardner! What would my dear mother have said if she&#x2019;d known! For her sake, for the sake of her memory, I had to go and say something to him, never mind if the other musicians laughed and said I was acting like a bell-boy.<br><br>But of course I couldn&#x2019;t just rush over to him, pushing aside the tables and chairs. There was our set to finish. It was agony, I can tell you, another three, four numbers, and every second I thought he was about to get up and walk off. But he kept sitting there, by himself, staring into his coffee, stirring it like he was really puzzled by what the waiter had brought him. He looked like any other American tourist, dressed in a pale-blue polo shirt and loose grey trousers. His hair, very dark, very shiny on those record covers, was almost white now, but there was still plenty of it, and it was immaculately groomed in the same style he&#x2019;d had back then. When I&#x2019;d first spotted him, he&#x2019;d had his dark glasses in his hand&#x2014;I doubt if I&#x2019;d have recognised him otherwise&#x2014;but as our set went on and I kept watching him, he put them on his face, took them off again, then back on again. He looked preoccupied and it disappointed me to see he wasn&#x2019;t really listening to our music.<br><br>Then our set was over. I hurried out of the tent without saying anything to the others, made my way to Tony Gardner&#x2019;s table, then had a moment&#x2019;s panic not knowing how to start the conversation. I was standing behind him, but some sixth sense made him turn and look up at me&#x2014;I guess it was all those years of having fans come up to him&#x2014; and next thing I was introducing myself, explaining how much I admired him, how I was in the band he&#x2019;d just been listening to, how my mother had been such a fan, all in one big rush. He listened with a grave expression, nodding every few seconds like he was my doctor. I kept talking and all he said every now and then was: &#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; After a while I thought it was time to leave and I&#x2019;d started to move away when he said:<br><br>&#x201c;So you come from one of those communist countries. That must have been tough.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all in the past.&#x201d; I did a cheerful shrug. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a free country now. A democracy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good to hear. And that was your crew playing for us just now. Sit down. You want some coffee?&#x201d;<br><br>I told him I didn&#x2019;t want to impose, but there was now something gently insistent about Mr. Gardner. &#x201c;No, no, sit down. Your mother liked my records, you were saying.&#x201d;<br><br>So I sat down and told him some more. About my mother, our apartment, the black-market records. And though I couldn&#x2019;t remember what the albums were called, I started describing the pictures on their sleeves the way I remembered them, and each time I did this, he&#x2019;d put his finger up in the air and say something like: &#x201c;Oh, that would be Inimitable. The Inimitable Tony Gardner.&#x201d; I think we were both really enjoying this game, but then I noticed Mr. Gardner&#x2019;s gaze move off me, and I turned just in time to see a woman coming up to our table.<br><br>She was one of those American ladies who are so classy, with great hair, clothes and figure, you don&#x2019;t realise they&#x2019;re not so young until you see them up close. Far away, I might have mistaken her for a model out of those glossy fashion magazines. But when she sat down next to Mr. Gardner and pushed her dark glasses onto her forehead, I realised she must be at least fifty, maybe more. Mr. Gardner said to me: &#x201c;This is Lindy, my wife.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Gardner flashed me a smile that was kind of forced, then said to her husband: &#x201c;So who&#x2019;s this? You&#x2019;ve made yourself a friend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, honey. I was having a good time talking here with . . . I&#x2019;m sorry, friend, I don&#x2019;t know your name.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jan,&#x201d; I said quickly. &#x201c;But friends call me Janeck.&#x201d;<br><br>Lindy Gardner said: &#x201c;You mean your nickname&#x2019;s longer than your real name? How does that work?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be rude to the man, honey.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not being rude.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make fun of the man&#x2019;s name, honey. That&#x2019;s a good girl.&#x201d;<br><br>Lindy Gardner turned to me with a helpless sort of expression. &#x201c;You know what he&#x2019;s talking about? Did I insult you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;not at all, Mrs. Gardner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s always telling me I&#x2019;m rude to the public. But I&#x2019;m not rude. Was I rude to you just now?&#x201d; Then to Mr. Gardner: &#x201c;I speak to the public in a natural way, sweetie. It&#x2019;s my way. I&#x2019;m never rude.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, honey,&#x201d; Mr. Gardner said, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s not make a big thing of it. Anyhow, this man here, he&#x2019;s not the public.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, he&#x2019;s not? Then what is he? A long-lost nephew?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Be nice, honey. This man, he&#x2019;s a colleague. A musician, a pro. He&#x2019;s just been entertaining us all.&#x201d; He gestured towards our marquee.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh right!&#x201d; Lindy Gardner turned to me again. &#x201c;You were playing up there just now? Well, that was pretty. You were on the accordion, right? Real pretty!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you very much. Actually, I&#x2019;m the guitarist.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Guitarist? You&#x2019;re kidding me. I was watching you only a minute ago. Sitting right there, next to the double bass man, playing so beautifully on your accordion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pardon me, that was in fact Carlo on the accordion. The big bald guy . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure? You&#x2019;re not kidding me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, I&#x2019;ve told you. Don&#x2019;t be rude to the man.&#x201d;<br><br>He hadn&#x2019;t shouted exactly, but his voice was suddenly hard and angry, and now there was a strange silence. Then Mr. Gardner himself broke it, saying gently:<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, honey. I didn&#x2019;t mean to snap at you.&#x201d;<br><br>He reached out a hand and grasped one of hers. I&#x2019;d kind of expected her to shake him off, but instead, she moved in her chair so she was closer to him, and put her free hand over their clasped pair. They sat there like that for a few seconds, Mr. Gardner, his head bowed, his wife gazing emptily past his shoulder, across the square towards the Basilica, though her eyes didn&#x2019;t seem to be seeing anything. For those few moments it was like they&#x2019;d forgotten not just me sitting with them, but all the people in the piazza. Then she said, almost in a whisper:<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay, sweetie. It was my fault. Getting you all upset.&#x201d;<br><br>They went on sitting like that a little longer, their hands locked. Then she sighed, let go of Mr. Gardner and looked at me. She&#x2019;d looked at me before, but this time it was different. This time I could feel her charm. It was like she had this dial, going zero to ten, and with me, at that moment, she&#x2019;d decided to turn it to six or seven, but I could feel it really strong, and if she&#x2019;d asked some favour of me&#x2014;if say she&#x2019;d asked me to go across the square and buy her some flowers&#x2014; I&#x2019;d have done it happily.<br><br>&#x201c;Janeck,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your name, right? I&#x2019;m sorry, Janeck. Tony&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;d no business speaking to you the way I did.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Gardner, really, please don&#x2019;t worry . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I disturbed the two of you talking. Musicians&#x2019; talk, I bet. You know what? I&#x2019;m gonna leave the two of you to get on with it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No reason to go, honey,&#x201d; Mr. Gardner said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yes there is, sweetie. I&#x2019;m absolutely yearning to go look in that Prada store. I only came over just now to tell you I&#x2019;d be longer than I said.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, honey.&#x201d; Tony Gardner straightened for the first time and took a deep breath. &#x201c;So long as you&#x2019;re sure you&#x2019;re happy doing that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna have a fantastic time in that store. So you two fellas, you have yourselves a good talk.&#x201d; She got to her feet and touched me on the shoulder. &#x201c;You take care, Janeck.&#x201d;<br><br>We watched her walk away, then Mr. Gardner asked me a few things about being a musician in Venice, and about the Quadri orchestra in particular, who&#x2019;d started playing just at that moment. He didn&#x2019;t seem to listen so carefully to my answers and I was about to excuse myself and leave, when he said suddenly:<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something I want to put to you, friend. Let me tell you what&#x2019;s on my mind and you can turn me down if that&#x2019;s what you want.&#x201d; He leaned forward and lowered his voice. &#x201c;Can I tell you something? The first time Lindy and I came here to Venice, it was our honeymoon. Twenty-seven years ago. And for all our happy memories of this place, we&#x2019;d never been back, not together anyway. So when we were planning this trip, this special trip of ours, we said to ourselves we&#x2019;ve got to spend a few days in Venice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your anniversary, Mr. Gardner?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anniversary?&#x201d; He looked startled.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I just thought, because you said this was your special trip.&#x201d;</p><h2>ATF102 - Classics Romantics Moderns Solos for the Intermediate Pianist</h2><p>This collection from Paul Sheftel of short pieces for piano by master composers presents the intermediate pianist with the "must haves" for piano students.

Miraculously, he got it. For one year Dunne went everywhere there was to go and talked to everyone worth talking to within the studio. He tracked every step of the creation of pictures like "Dr. Dolittle," "Planet of the Apes," and "The Boston Strangler." The result is a work of reportage that, thirty years later, may still be our most minutely observed and therefore most uproariously funny portrait of the motion picture business.<br><br>Whether he is recounting a showdown between Fox's studio head and two suave shark-like agents, watching a producer's girlfriend steal a silver plate from a restaurant, or shielding his eyes against the glare of a Hollywood premiere where the guests include a chimp in a white tie and tails, Dunne captures his subject in all its showmanship, savvy, vulgarity, and hype. Not since F. Scott Fitzgerald and Nathanael West has anyone done Hollywood better.<br><br>"Reads as racily as a novel...(Dunne) has a novelist's ear for speech and eye for revealing detail...Anyone who has tiptoed along those corridors of power is bound to say that Dunne's impressionism rings true."--Los Angeles Times</p><p><b>John Gregory Dunne</b> wrote six novels&#x2014;<i>Vegas; True Confessions; Dutch Shea, Jr.; The Red White and Blue;</i>&nbsp;<i>Playland; </i>and<i> Nothing Lost</i>&#x2014;and seven works of nonfiction, among which are the memoir-like&nbsp;<i>Harp&nbsp;</i>and two books that look at Hollywood,&nbsp;<i>The Studio&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Monster.&nbsp;</i>Born in West Hartford, Connecticut, in 1932, he graduated from Princeton in 1954.

They hate everything&#x2013;except playing mean jokes on each other, catching unsuspecting birds to put in their bird pies, and making their caged monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps, stand on their heads all day. But the Muggle-Wumps have had enough. With the help of Roly-Poly Bird, they set out to get some well-deserved revenge.</p><p>Roald Dahl is one of the best-loved children&#x2019;s book authors of all time. Although he passed away in 1990, his popularity and that of his many books continues to grow.THE TWITS is the ultimate story of tit for tat. With antics including a glass eye on the loose and a frog-bedecked pillow, Mr. and Mrs. Twit vie to outdo each other with nastiness. But it's the Muggle-Wumps, with help from the Roly-Poly Bird, who have the last, topsy-turvy, say. From the opening description of Mr. Twit's food-encrusted beard, the listener knows that Simon Callow delights in portraying this detestable being and his wife. The drool of the tongue and the slurps of the wormy spaghetti will bring chuckles of pleasure and disgust, as will Callow's animated description of "the shrinks." He personalizes the Muggle-Wumps with relish. His lilt and cadence for the Roly-Poly Bird evoke its origins. Whether young listeners are attracted or repulsed by the Twits, the presentation is marvelous.

The authors (they&#39;re both Catholic theologians: Johnson teaches at Emory U., Kurz at Marquette U.) have contributed five chapters each on their approaches to Biblical interpretation, chapters in which they respond to each other&#39;s work, and a co-written conclusion offering their views on the importance of maintaining a Catholic identity in Biblical scholarship.</p><p>Luke Timothy Johnson and William Kurz are Roman Catholic New Testament scholars who think that the apparent good health of biblical scholarship in America is deceptive. Despite its huge production of learning, Catholic scholarship has lost some of its soul because of its distance from the life and concerns of living faith communities. In this volume the authors open a conversation with others in the church concerning a future Catholic biblical scholarship that maintains the freedom of critical inquiry but within a living loyalty to tradition.<p></p><p>Looking not to criticize but to strengthen, the authors model the type of dialogue that is needed today. Johnson first reviews the current state of Catholic biblical scholarship and then points out important lessons from throughout the tradition of interpretation. He calls for imagining the world that Scripture imagines as the presupposition for the organic use of the Bible in theology. Kurz responds to Johnson's chapters and then offers his own approach to biblical interpretation, showing how literary analysis of the Gospel of John can be brought into conversation with the Nicene Creed, with recent debates in ethics, and with the practices of the church. After Johnson responds to Kurz, the authors jointly conclude by addressing a series of questions concerning hard issues now facing Catholic biblical scholarship.</p></p><h2>The Indian Cemetery (Volume 13) (Sugar Creek Gang Original Series)</h2><p>Join the <i>Sugar Creek Gang</i> for more adventures in Minnesota's Lake Country.

The master, now gifted with superhuman strength and senses, must flee his fearful Luddite fellows or face death. The similarly gifted, space-faring Rykashans take him in and use more "nanites" to bring their low-tech stray up to speed. <i>Pssht!</i> A spray can of nanites teaches the master the rudiments of Rykashan society. <i>Pssht!</i> He then learns to be a space janitor. <i>Pssht!</i> He later becomes a "needle jockey," a sort of interstellar flying-ace/truck driver, who even gets to talk to God (or <i>a</i> god, at any rate).<p> Leave it to L.E. Modesitt, Jr. (<i>Fall of Angels</i>, <i>Ghost of the Revelator</i>) to pull this sort of weirdness. But, as should be expected from such an inventive author, the quirky mise-en-sc�ne serves a purpose: setting a story of personal transformation against a <i>Twilight Zone</i>-ian backdrop of contrasting societies, ethics, and tech levels. Although flat in spots and maybe a little pokey, <i>Gravity Dreams</i> is a winning little SF drama, the tale of one man's realization that true knowledge doesn't come from a can. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>L.E.

Peters was named Grandmaster at the inaugural Anthony Awards in 1986, Grandmaster by the Mystery Writers of America at the Edgar(R) Awards in 1998, and given The Lifetime Achievement Award at Malice Domestic in 2003. She lives in an historic farmhouse in western Maryland.Marianne Ransom, orphaned daughter of a country squire, is rescued from a questionable living on the back streets of London by a mysterious attorney. Adopted by a wealthy duchess, she's told she isn't who she thinks she is and that she has powers she never knew existed. Norma West delivers Marianne's part with a spirited sweetness. The young Duke Henry, a spoiled child of 12, is revealed as a mischievous, but thoroughly lovable, brat (like many boys that age). West's portrayals of other characters are less adept, especially the men. Overall, the production offers lively entertainment from start to finish, remarkably free of the dull spots that plague so many unabridged books.

It is one of a handful of seminal texts published shortly after World War II that opened the pathways for new approaches to psychotherapy that remain in print today, over a half-century later. Interest in Gestalt therapy was limited primarily to mental health practitioners for almost twenty years when it suddenly captured the interest of many diverse groups outside the healing professions including educators, members of the clergy, and the general public. When a photograph of one of its founders, Frederick (Fritz) Perls, was featured in a story and a full-page color photograph in Life magazine, it became the &#34;in&#34; therapeutic method of the moment. The publicity brought the attention of the mental health community to Gestalt therapy and among the first books published in almost two decades intended primary for the professional was this book, Gestalt Therapy Now. The contributors, Arnold Beisser, Lois Brien, Henry Close, Ruth Cohn, Bruce Denner, Katherine Ennis, John Burke Enright, Joen Fagan, Walter Kempler, Elaine Kepner, Janet Lederman, Abraham Levitsky, Sandra Mitchell, Claudio Naranjo, Vincent Francis O&#39;Connell, Frederick Perls, Laura Perls, Janie Rhyne, Marilyn B. Rosanes-Berrett, Irma Lee Shepherd, James S. Simkin, and Richard W. Wallen were the leading Gestalt trainers and practitioners of the time.

Now Martini delivers the most daunting capital case of Madriani's career.<br><br>Paul Madriani has ample reason to suspect he's representing a guilty man. Dr. David Crone, a respected medical researcher and principal in mapping the human genome, is charged with the murder of a young colleague: twenty-six-year-old Kalista Jordan, an African-American research physician whose body washed up on a beach in San Diego Bay. Forensic evidence links her murder with material in Crone's garage. Crone had both opportunity and motive: Kalista had recently ended their affair, and may have been deserting him professionally as well, moving on to a rival genetic research facility. However, when a key witness for the prosecution dies unexpectedly, leaving an incriminating note behind, Crone's innocence seems confirmed-until Madriani hits upon a potentially damning loose end.</p><p>So much of the action in this courtroom thriller happens outside the jury's purview that it makes one wonder if there's a touch of irony intended in the title. Paul Madriani, the lawyer-hero of five previous Martini novels set in San Francisco, has moved to San Diego for reasons that are never made clear. He's taken on the case of David Crone, a doctor involved in mapping the human genome, who's been charged with the murder of his colleague, a young African American research physician whose ambitions threatened Crone's career. <p> Crone seems to have had ample motivation for killing Kalista Jordan: witnesses have testified to the friction between them, and Crone himself seems less concerned about the capital murder charge than about what may be going on in his lab. When a key witness for the prosecution dies in what looks like a suicide and leaves a note confessing to the murder, Crone is freed. And in an O. Henry-like twist in the last chapter, a most unlikely killer emerges and threatens Madriani's life. </p><p> But even this doesn't do much to enliven this slow-moving novel. There's very little tension on the page or in the plot, and neither the narrative nor the characters offer the reader the kind of excitement found in Martini's previous novels. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p>Steve Martini is the author of numerous New York Times bestsellers, including The Enemy Inside, Trader of Secrets, The Rule of Nine, Guardian of Lies, Shadow of Power, Double Tap, and others featuring defense attorney Paul Madriani.

The ladder represents an inflexible view in which prestige, rewards, access to information, influence, power, etc. are tied to the rung one occupies. The problem is, the authors argue, we no longer live in the industrial age.<br><br>The pace of change is faster. Work is increasingly virtual, collaborative, and dispersed. Organizations are flatter. Companies are much easier to see into. Careers zig and zag. Work is done wherever, whenever. And information flows in all directions. The result? The ladder model along with the outdated norms and expectations that defined it is collapsing.<br><br>In their best-selling book, The Corporate Lattice: Achieving High Performance in the Changing World of Work, author Cathy Benko and co-author Molly Anderson define the emerging Corporate LatticeTM model and argue convincingly that a lattice is better suited for today&#x2019;s global business environment. They describe the shift across three dimensions:<br><br>--How careers are built: From straight up to zigzag. Rather than a series of linear career paths, lattice organizations offer customized options for growth and development. Lattice ways to build careers attract and engage the best talent and create versatile employees well suited to respond to change.<br><br>--How work gets done: From where you go to what you do. Rather than expecting people to sit at their desks clocking face time from 9 to 5, lattice organizations offer options for when, where, and how people do their work. Lattice ways to work increase productivity and retention while increasing strategic flexibility in business operations.<br><br>--How participation is fostered: From top-down to all-in.

It argues persuasively that the old corporate ladder metaphor is dead. What has emerged in its place is the corporate lattice, which is flatter and more collaborative and in tune with the changing workplace and workforce. You will find yourself nodding in agreement with the analysis of this new world and taking notes on what to do about it. This is a book that will have a profound and positive impact. I recommend it highly.&#x201d;<br>-- Anne Mulcahy, Chairman, Xerox Corporation<br><br> The right model for the times.

Because of these factors, more people aren&#x2019;t necessarily climbing the ladder&#x201d; like they once were. They&#x2019;re working from home and available 24/7 (as opposed to 9 to 5), they&#x2019;re looking for challenges, and they want to learn new things. Thus, the old corporate model also needs to adjust, and The Corporate Lattice provides the framework to make changes.<br>As Shelly Lazarus, Chairman, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, states on the back cover: Anyone responsible for driving results should read this book.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s true.

Berger is arguably the best-known American sociologist living today. Since the 1960s he has been publishing books on many facets of the American social scene, and several are now considered classics. So it may be hard to believe Professor Berger&#39;s description of himself as an &#34;accidental sociologist.&#34; But that in fact accurately describes how he stumbled into sociology. In this witty, intellectually stimulating memoir, Berger explains not only how he became a social scientist, but the many adventures that this calling has led to. Rather than writing an autobiography, he focuses on the main intellectual issues that motivated his work and the various people and situations he encountered in the course of his career. Full of memorable vignettes and colorful characters depicted in a lively narrative often laced with humor, Berger&#39;s memoir conveys the excitement that a study of social life can bring. The first part of the book describes Berger&#39;s initiation into sociology through the New School for Social Research, &#34;a European enclave in the midst of Greenwich Village bohemia.&#34; Berger was first a student at the New School and later a young professor amidst a clique of like-minded individuals. There he published The Social Construction of Reality (with colleague Thomas Luckmann), one of his most successful books, followed by The Sacred Canopy on the sociology of religion, also still widely cited.The book covers Berger&#39;s experience as a &#34;globe-trekking sociologist&#34; including trips to Mexico, where he studied approaches to Third World poverty; to East Asia, where he discovered the potential of capitalism to improve social conditions; and to South Africa, where he chaired an international study group on the future of post-Apartheid society.Berger then tells about his role as the director of a research center at Boston University. For over two decades he and his colleagues have been tackling such important issues as globalization, the secularization of Europe, and the ongoing dialectic between relativism and fundamentalism in contemporary culture.What comes across throughout is Berger&#39;s boundless curiosity with the many ways in which people interact in society. This book offers longtime Berger readers as well as newcomers to sociology proof that the sociologist&#39;s attempt to explain the world is anything but boring.</p><p><b>Peter L. Berger </b>(Boston, MA) is University Professor of Sociology, Emeritus, at Boston University and the founder and Senior Research Fellow of the Institute on Culture, Religion, and World Affairs. He has written numerous books on sociological theory, the sociology of religion, and Third World development. Among his more recent books are <i>In Praise of Doubt</i> (with Anton Zijderveld);<i> Religious America, Secular Europe? </i>(with Grace Davie and Effie Fokas); <i>Questions of Faith; Many Globalizations</i> (edited with Samuel Huntington); and <i>Redeeming Laughter: The Comic Dimension of Human Experience</i>. Professor Berger has received honorary degrees from Loyola University, University of Notre Dame, University of Geneva, University of Munich, Sofia University, and Renmin University of China."Few writers have had as wide an impact on contemporary thinking about the sociology of modern society, culture, and religion as Peter Berger. Here now from this distinguished scholar is another <b>wonderfully engaging book</b>, filled with candid personal detail, compelling humor, and characteristic sophistication in its understanding of the complex world in which we live." --Robert Wuthnow, department chair of Sociology at Princeton University<p>"Peter Berger's memoir, a journey in ideas, is <b>an inspired reading of our times</b>. His many gifts as thinker and writer are on splendid display. He recounts how as a sociologically minded analyst of religion, he abandoned one of the central pieties of both European and American sociology, namely, secularization theory, and developed an enduring research agenda. His tireless work as an intellectual engaged in public issues has led to new and better understandings of the social forces of religion and economic development throughout the world. Peter Berger is that rare person whose commanding intellect is matched by his enormous generosity to generations of students and colleagues who recognize in him the true spirit of intellectual inquiry. Social scientists have a great deal to learn from him and his skillful 'art of mistrust' at the core of his approach to social reality. As he concludes, 'A morally sensitive social scientist will, I think, instinctively move toward middle positions (middle between radical change and stubborn preservation) on most issues.'" --Jonathan B.

Before integrating Broadway in 1910 via a controversial stint with the Ziegfeld Follies, Williams was already an international icon. Yet his name has faded into near obscurity, his extraordinary accomplishments forgotten largely because he performed in blackface. Louis Chude-Sokei contends that Williams&#x2019;s blackface was not a display of internalized racism nor a submission to the expectations of the moment. It was an appropriation and exploration of the contradictory and potentially liberating power of racial stereotypes.<p></p><p>Chude-Sokei makes the crucial argument that Williams&#x2019;s minstrelsy negotiated the place of black immigrants in the cultural hotbed of New York City and was replicated throughout the African diaspora, from the Caribbean to Africa itself. Williams was born in the Bahamas. When performing the &#x201c;darky,&#x201d; he was actually masquerading as an African American. This black-on-black minstrelsy thus challenged emergent racial constructions equating &#x201c;black&#x201d; with African American and marginalizing the many diasporic blacks in New York. It also dramatized the practice of passing for African American common among non-American blacks in an African American&#x2013;dominated Harlem. Exploring the thought of figures such as Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey, and Claude McKay, Chude-Sokei situates black-on-black minstrelsy at the center of burgeoning modernist discourses of assimilation, separatism, race militancy, carnival, and internationalism. While these discourses were engaged with the question of representing the &#x201c;Negro&#x201d; in the context of white racism, through black-on-black minstrelsy they were also deployed against the growing international influence of African American culture and politics in the twentieth century.</p></p><p>&#34;With theoretical verve and archival aplomb, Louis Chude-Sokei explores an open secret that we too often have preferred to ignore: the central role of black minstrelsy in the origins of the Harlem Renaissance. Starting with the simple fact of Bert Williams&#39;s Caribbean origins, he finds the multiple layers of masquerade in any performance of &#39;race.&#39; A timely, often profound portrait of the dynamics of intraracial difference in diaspora.&#34;--Brent Hayes Edwards, author of &#34;The Practice of Diaspora &#34;<p>Louis Chude-Sokei is Professor of English and African American Studies at Boston University.</p></p><h2>Pragmatism Versus Marxism: An Appraisal of John Dewey&#39;s Philosophy</h2><p>A defense of Marxism against the pragmatism of John Dewey, chief theoretical spokesman in the 1930s of the middle-class democratic movement in the United States. <p> Index, Further Reading/Bibliography</p></p><p></p><h2>The Bone Chamber (Sidney Fitzpatrick)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;A very talented writer&#x201d; (Lee Child), who is &#x201c;smart, tough, and right on the mark&#x201d; (Catherine Coulter), and &#x201c;among the best writers of crime fiction&#x201d; (Jan Burke), Anthony Award-winning author Robin Burcell broadens her canvas with <em>The Bone Chamber</em>&#x2014;an electrifying thriller that recalls the best of James Rollins and Dan Brown as it races across the globe.

This is the first English language publication. Shortly after becoming the German war-games champion, Udo Berger and his girlfriend, Ingeborg, holiday on the Costa Brava. There they meet another vacationing German couple, Charly and Hanna, and a band of shady locals who introduce them to the darker side of life in the town. Then, late one night, Charly disappears without a trace, and Udo&#39;s well-ordered life is thrown into upheaval . . . Frightened, Udo refuses to leave, even after Ingeborg returns home, and his increasingly feverish dreams push him into delirium. As everything slips beyond his grasp, he attempts to re-assert himself by engaging the enigmatic and severely disfigured El Quemado - a foreigner who lives in a Spartan burrow on the beach - in a days-long match of his favourite war game, Third Reich. But, too late to stop the madness, he realizes that the consequences of this game are much more serious than he ever imagined. Combining the exhilaration of The Savage Detectives with the darkness of his later work, The Third Reich - Bola�o&#39;s first new novel since the epic 2666 - is a visceral book exploring memory, madness and violence. It is both the perfect way to discover the dazzling genius of Roberto Bola�o and an unmissable addition to the oeuvre for those who already have. &#39;Bola�o writes with such elegance, verve and style and is immensely readable&#39; Guardian &#39;Readers who have snacked on a writer such as Haruki Murakami will feast on Roberto Bola�o&#39; Sunday Times The Author Roberto Bola�o was born in Santiago, Chile, in 1953.

Bolano draws a fine line between memory and reality, but blurs them in the final pages, as the novel slowly drifts from realism to a nightmarish fever dream--leaving readers with an ending that is ambiguous yet haunting. <em>--Kevin Nguyen</em></p>Roberto Bolano was born in Santiago, Chile, in 1953.

Archeanassa of Colophon, subject of a poem attributed by Diogenes Laertius to Plato, has returned to her birthplace in search of the lost manuscripts of another ex-lover, the poet Antimachus. There she encounters Perictione, Plato's niece, who lives alone in the ruined and brutalized city amid memories and dreams. Perictione tells the strange story of Merope of Sardis, the Nietzschean philosopher who both made and destroyed her life. Little by little Archeanassa comes to recognize that Perictione's story is also her own story, and that the mystery of Colophon is the mystery of modernity itself. Through dialogues, stories, and fantasies, the narrative explores the aesthetic way of life, and the possibilities of meaning in an age of inverted commas.<p>As original in form as it is inspired in content, Perictione in Colophon will take its place as one of the major philosophical statements of our time, and one which gives a moving and memorable account of two women seek, and finding, consolation.</p><p>This is how philosophy was meant to be learned.</p></p><p>Scruton has been called the most amusing philosopher writing today. This mock Platonic dialogue, which includes much narration and description, bears that characterization out. The aged Plato has dispatched his former lover Archeanassa to her hometown, Colophon, now under Persian rule, to retrieve the manuscripts of the poet Antimachus, an earlier love of hers. She finds Colophon utterly changed, a city of featureless office towers and a populace sharply divided into a gray mass of citizen-workers and an elite of imperial-military overlords. She also finds Perictione, a young cousin of Plato's who lives in her own Greek aesthetic oasis and who engages her in discussions of architecture, dance, and music. Those subjects come up as Perictione relates the life of her mentor Merope, an itinerant philosopher with whom she traveled before settling in Colophon. Cynicism, egalitarianism, and the decline of taste and civilization under both totalitarian and free-market conditions also figure in the women's exchanges. As in Plato's dialogues, character and incident prove as engaging as philosophy in Scruton's tour de force. <i>Ray Olson</i>"A riotous send-up of scholarly writing.

Royal governor of North Carolina from 1765 to 1771 and then of New York from 1771 to 1780, Tryon became a general in the British army attempting to quell the American rebellion. This biography covers his life in service to the Crown through the end of the American Revolution.<br><br>Paul Nelson argues that Tryon was a talented colonial administrator and a successful, even popular, governor largely because he understood American thinking on such basic constitutional issues as taxation, finance, and trade policy. British home authorities failed to follow Tryon's sage counsel regarding the governance of the colonies, advice that might have forestalled the Revolution. In particular, Tryon, like Edmund Burke and others in Parliament, could not convince British ministers that Americans would never accept internal taxes imposed upon them by London.<br><br>Once the war broke out and Tryon's role changed from governing to leading Loyalist American troops, he was an advocate of harsh, retributive warfare against his former charges. Nelson follows Tryon's military career, especially his debates with colleagues such as Sir Henry Clinton on the wisdom of hard-line versus conciliatory approach to the fighting. And after the war, Nelson shows, Tryon's connections with those unfortunate Americans who came out on the losing side of the great imperial struggle retained an important place in his life. <br><br>An exciting drama in its own right, Tryon's story also serves to illuminate a number of issues important to historians of the Revolutionary War. Played out on two continents and in two important American colonies, amid the stirring events that resulted in the formation of the United States of America, Tryon's life is significant for understanding many aspects of politics and society in the Anglo-American world of the eighteenth century.<br><br>Originally published in 1990.<br><br>A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.

With unimpeded access to the young performer, Wertheimer was able to capture the unguarded and everyday moments in Elvis' life during that crucial year, a year that took him from Tupelo, Mississippi to the silver screen, and to the verge of international stardom and his crowning as "The King of Rock 'n' Roll.&#x201d; As Alfred Wertheimer photographed Elvis during 1956, and again in 1958, he created classic images that are spontaneous, unrehearsed and completely without artifice.<br>Wertheimer&#x2019;s photographs of Elvis are extraordinary and he appears almost ethereal, whether reading a newspaper while waiting for a cab, or washing his hands during one of his many train trips. After 1958 and Elvis&#x2019; induction into the army, the world seemingly forgot about Wertheimer&#x2019;s magical photographs- for nineteen years- until Aug 16, 1977, the day Elvis died and Time Magazine called. The phone hasn&#x2019;t really stopped ringing in the last thirty years,&#x201d; observes Wertheimer.<br>Many of the photographs in this visual treasury are previously unpublished and some have become almost as famous as the man himself.</p><p>Alfred Wertheimer was born in Germany in 1930, came to America and settled in Brooklyn as a young boy. He took an early interest in architecture and design, which led him to Cooper Union, from which he graduated in 1951. In the spring of 1956, a series of commercial assignments for RCA Records led to a shoot of a newly signed singer named Elvis Presley. Instantly impressed, Wertheimer devoted four months of his own time to intensely shadow the young star. The result would be the most intimate and candid look at the future legend ever recorded. <br>Peter Guralnick is an award-winning biographer of Elvis Presley and author of <i>Last Train to Memphis</i> and <i>Careless Love</i>. A music critic, screenwriter, and historian of American popular music, he is also the author of <i>Dream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke</i>.In March 1956, photographer Wertheimer took an assignment from RCA Victor Records to go over to the Dorsey brothers' TV show and start the company's photo file on a singer he had never heard, Elvis Presley. During a few days of the same year in New York; in Richmond, Virginia; on a train; and in Memphis, Wertheimer started a file, all right. Especially since Elvis' death, many of Wertheimer's images have become very famous, but seeing them in the context of scores of their assignment mates confirms that they are only a hair better than the others, if that. Every picture in this 11-by-14-inch behemoth, whether of Elvis performing, rehearsing, recording, dressing, sleeping, eating, relaxing with family, or putting the moves on lovely young women----Wertheimer captured all of this--is a beaut.

This book focuses on those all-important areas, with the exclusion of overhauls. The book presents fundamental principles and identifies the separate systems (fuel, cooling, etc.). Systems are explained and the required maintenance tasks presented in a checklist format. Safety precautions also are stressed. A separate chapter is devoted to engine operation: warm-up, normal running, and shutdown. Copious illustrations and step-by-step instructions are all p art of the author&#39;s clean, well-organized method of presentation. The boat owner need not be an experienced mechanic to perform routine maintenance chores on his or her engine, and special tools are not required. The explanation of the basic engine systems and routine tasks presented in Diesel Engines, augmented by the manufacturer&#39;s operating manual, puts the actual accomplishment of these jobs well within the capability of even a nontechnical boat owner.</p><p>Born in Vladivostok, Russia, Leo Block began amassing engineering experience in the U.S. Navy, where he attended several technical schools and served in the engineering department of steam- and diesel-powered ships. Following his naval service, Block&#39;s work experience as an engineer was with leading manufacturers of combustion and heat-transfer products. He obtained his undergraduate and master&#39;s degrees from the University of Southern California. A registered professional engineer, he holds a U.S. Coast Guard license for 100-ton vessels, power and sail, and is a retired U.S. Naval Reserve Captain. He has written articles for Yachting, Appliance, and Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration News, and is a member of the American Society of Gas Engineers and the Carbon Monoxide Safety and Health Association. His technical writings have been published in technical magazines and engineering society transactions, and he has more than twenty U.S. and foreign patents. He is the author of Diesel Engines: A Boat Owner&#39;s Guide to Operation and Maintenance.In this amply illustrated and straightforward guide, Leo Block, an old Navy hand, sets himself the formidable task of filling the gap between what you learn from your engine's owner's manual (almost nil) and what you find in the technician's service manual (far too much). It should be stressed that this book is not designed to teach the novice how to fix a broken diesel. The doit-yourself suggestions are strictly limited to the routine service procedures you'd find in the most cursory owner's manual: changing the lubricating oil, ensuring a clean fuel supply, replacing filters, bleeding air from oil lines, etc. The question arises, then, whether this book is filling a much-needed void. For pleasure boaters unsatisfied with a monkey-see-monkey-do approach to diesel maintenance, the answer is no. The value of this book, then, lies in its lucid explanation of the complex mechanical principles at work in diesel engines: the "why" behind the "do." While it won't turn you into a mechanic, it may just keep you from being conned the first time you sail into the yard for a tune-up. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>The Laws of Success &amp; Happiness</h2><p>2013 Reprint of 1929 Edition.

Each chapter is a month, divided into three parts: New York City, the author's garden, and her kitchen, each setting the stage for a lavish seasonal menu with recipes drawn from farmers markets, wild-foraged ingredients, and produce grown on her city terrace and roof farm.Named for the size of her tiny Brooklyn terrace, and the blog it inspired, Viljoen's book is a unique perspective of the concrete jungle, where the month is known by the flowers in bloom, the vegetable in season, and the migrating birds criss-crossing a Brooklyn sky. It reveals a side of the city that few people know, and inspires a thoughtful way of living that is gaining traction in the 21st century. &nbsp;Set against a backdrop of growing up in South Africa and moving to the United States, meeting her French husband, and finding a culinary and emotional home in Brooklyn, Viljoen's book is a love letter to living seasonally in the most famous city on the planet.</p><p><b>Marie Viljoen&nbsp;</b>Marie Viljoen is a writer, forager, gardener, and cook, and has loved edible plants since her childhood in South Africa.

This beautiful dog also plays a starring role in <i>Man's Best Friend</i>, where he is caught posing, napping, and playing in more than 40 (mainly color) photographs. Wegman dresses his dog in a variety of costumes--transforming him into a strange new creature--half man, half canine. Each exquisite portrait is a testament to Man Ray's beauty--and the strong bond between dog and master. This handsome book is one you'll admire time and time again.This amusing volume is photographer Wegmen's tribute to Man Ray, not the fellow shutterbug but his dog and partner whom he dressed up as everything from an elephant to an Indian chief.

It took me many years to learn how to draw like these children."--Pablo Picasso, upon viewing an exhibition of children's drawings, as quoted by Sir Herbert Read in 1945</p><br><p>The idea that modern art looks like something a child can do is a long-standing clich�. For some modernists, however, the connection between their work and children's art was direct and explicit. This groundbreaking and heretical book, centered on such modern masters as Klee, Kandinsky, Picasso, and Mir�, presents for the first time material from the collections of child art that these artists actually possessed as they undertook some of the greatest masterworks of their careers. As the first art historian to pursue this connection in detail, Jonathan Fineberg here explores the importance of children's art to the work of key modernists from Matisse to Jackson Pollock. Fineberg's inquiry unfolds in this handsome book, which juxtaposes modern masterpieces with the drawings by children that directly influenced them. Fineberg discusses the effect of primitivism and Freudian thought on some of these artists, and demonstrates how they valued children's art for many reasons, including its naive spontaneity and celebration of the moment, imaginative use of visual language, and its universality and candor. For each of the masters who collected child art, the reasons for doing so are as varied as his or her unique style.</p><br><p>Fineberg has uncovered most of these major collections of child art assembled by celebrated modernists. Many examples from these collections are reproduced in this book for the first time, together with explanations as to why expressionists, cubists, futurists, and others displayed the art of children alongside their own work in exhibitions of the early twentieth century. In chapters devoted to Larionov, Kandinsky and M�nter, Klee, Picasso, Mir�, Dubuffet, the Cobra artists, and artists after World War II, Fineberg examines how each artist exploited aspects of child art to formulate his or her own artistic breakthroughs.</p><br><p>With over 170 color plates and 140 black and white illustrations, this visually compelling book will stimulate new research among art historians and will inspire museum visitors to see some of their favorite modern masterpieces in a new way.</p></p><p><br> <p>"<i>The Innocent Eye</i> is a provocative and refreshing contribution to be enjoyed by the average reader and to encourage in the specialist a new 'innocence' in both eye and mind."<b>--Anne Coffin Hanson, the John Hay Whitney Professor Emerita of History of Art at Yale University</b><br> </p><br><b>Jonathan Fineberg</b> is Professor of Art History and University Scholar at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

What is the value of things made by an anonymous craftsman working in a set tradition for a lifetime? What is the value of handwork? Why should even the roughly lacquered rice bowl of a Japanese farmer be thought beautiful? The late Soetsu Yanagi was the first to fully explore the traditional Japanese appreciation for "objects born, not made."<br><br>Mr. Yanagi sees folk art as a manifestation of the essential world from which art, philosophy, and religion arise and in which the barriers between them disappear. The implications of the author's ideas are both far-reaching and practical.<br><br>Soetsu Yanagi is often mentioned in books on Japanese art, but this is the first translation in any Western language of a selection of his major writings. The late Bernard Leach, renowned British potter and friend of Mr. Yanagi for fifty years, has clearly transmitted the insights of one of Japan's most important thinkers. The seventy-six plates illustrate objects that underscore the universality of his concepts. The author's profound view of the creative process and his plea for a new artistic freedom within tradition are especially timely now when the importance of craft and the handmade object is being rediscovered.</p><p><br>SOETSU YANAGI was born in Tokyo in 1889 and graduated from the literature department of the Tokyo Imperial University in 1913, majoring in psychology. Proficient in English and with a deep feeling for art, while still a student Mr. Yanagi became associated with the Shirakaba ("Silver Birch") literary group, to which he was partly responsible for interpreting Western art to Japan.<br><br>In 1921, he completed the organization of a Korean folkcraft museum in Seoul, and, in 1936, the present Japan Folkcraft Museum in Tokyo was completed through his efforts.<br><br>Mr. Yanagi traveled widely in the Orient, Europe, and America. In 1929 he lectured at Harvard University for one year. In Japan, sometimes in the company of the potters Kanjiro Kawai, Shoji Hamada, and Bernard Leach, he sought out anonymous craftsman of all kinds throughout the country and encouraged their work. He also wrote prolifically and profoundly on all aspects of aesthetics, finding his inspiration in Japanese and Oriental folkcraft and folk culture. His personal collection of folkcrafts is the nucleus of the Japan Folkcraft Museum collection. Mr. Yanagi died in Tokyo in 1961.<br><br>The Adaptor, BERNARD LEACH today is known as one of the world's greatest potters. His numerous books are familiar to everyone interested in modem crafts. Mr. Leach first came to Japan at the age of 22, in 1909, met the Shirakaba group and soon became an intimate friend of Soetsu Yanagi. It is difficult to say which of the two men influenced the other the more. In Mr. Yanagi's own words, "Leach came to Japan... full of dreams and wonder.... It is doubtful if any other visitor from the West ever shared our spiritual life so completely". This volume is Mr. Leach's tribute to his friend of fifty years standing.<br>Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>Going, Going, Gone! with the Pain and the Great One</h2><p>THE PAIN AND the Great One are going places!

He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.The author of the popular Rumpole stories as well as the lacerating political novel <i>Paradise Postponed</i> (1986) opens this tenderhearted sequel to his first autobiography (<i>Clinging to the Wreckage</i> [1987]) with anecdotes from his career as a queen's counsel, when he found himself establishing short-term but intense friendships with hard-core criminals during the course of their trials. His schizoid existence as a writer with a day job as a lawyer leads to a delightful juxtaposition of people and events, so that a description of a sordid murder trial is followed by a story about a raucous party thrown by director Tony Richardson. Pressured to practice law by his father--an avid gardener whose "ghost . . . is a hard one to banish, I still see him feeling for the flowers in his blindness . . . dressed in an ancient tweed suit"--Mortimer eventually quit the law to devote himself to writing. He talks of visiting Moscow with the Royal Shakespeare Company and swapping oft-heard jokes with a dying David Niven. In a self-deprecating, dryly amusing, unforgettable voice, Mortimer offers up the second part of his life story in a style so fluid, it seems effortless. <i>Joanne Wilkinson</i></p><h2>British Manor Murder (A Lucy Stone Mystery)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Reading a new Lucy Stone mystery is like catching up with a dear old friend.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kate Carlisle,<i> New York Times </i>bestselling author</b><br><br><i>It&#x2019;s a nippy spring in Tinker&#x2019;s Cove, Maine, and so Lucy Stone can&#x2019;t wait to join her friend Sue at the Earl of Wickham&#x2019;s manor in England for the &#x201c;Heads Up!&#x201d; hat exhibition&#x2014;even if she has to spend her entire holiday curtseying.

A forceful clarity of purpose and vision has characterized his art and his career from the start: he dominated the New York art scene of the late 1950s with his <i>Black Paintings</i> composed of stripes, which famously helped pave the way for Minimalism, and which were exhibited in The Museum of Modern Art, New York&#x2019;s milestone exhibition <i>Sixteen Americans</i>, alongside Johns and Rauschenberg. In 1970 Stella became the youngest artist to receive a show at The Museum of Modern Art, by which time he had already blazed his way through several stylistic evolutions. To the surprise of many, the passionate race-car driver did not follow the seemingly inevitable route towards Minimalism, and instead followed a path that led him to ever more opulent and baroque reliefs. With this idiosyncratic turn &#x201c;from Minimalist to Maximalist,&#x201d; Stella developed into one of the boldest artists of the twentieth century.<br> On the occasion of Stella&#x2019;s comprehensive retrospective at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, this massive survey celebrates the many lives of Frank Stella. It includes classic examples of each of his many periods, such as the <i>Black Paintings</i>, <i>Irregular Polygons</i>, the <i>Protractor</i> paintings, the <i>Circuits</i> series, the metal reliefs and floor sculptures of the past two decades and an &#x201c;ArchiSkulptur&#x201d; conceived by the artist exclusively for the exhibition. With more than 660 color reproductions, this volume is as ambitious and spectacular as its subject.<br><b>Frank Stella</b> was born in 1936, to first-generation Sicilians, and grew up in a suburb of Boston. In 1954 he entered Princeton University, where he took a night class in painting and drawing. His first solo exhibition was at the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1960.</p><p>In 1970, at age 34, Stella became the youngest artist to be given a full-scale retrospective at MOMA. His second retrospective there is celebrated by this expensive catalog, whose author is director of painting and sculpture at the museum.

The work is intended for all interested readers and is suitable for both popular and scholarly interests. The purpose is to expand the "understanding of circumstances that shaped a woman and her life" in antiquity.<p>Content is organized alphabetically by the names most commonly used in ancient literature, then chronologically in the case of similarly named subjects. Subjects include the familiar, such as Aspasia, Boadicea, and Sappho, and the lesser known, such as the Arete (fifth^-fourth century B.C.E.), a Greek philosopher; and Marcia (first century B.C.E.), wife of Cato the Younger. Entries include the subject's name(s), dates (if known), cultural identity, home, description, citations to source material, and cross-references. Length ranges from a few lines (e.g., <i>Cleito</i>) to several pages (e.g., <i>Cleopatra VII</i>).</p><p>Twenty-three illustrations appear throughout the text. Access points include a table of contents, "Registry," and index. The Registry is an alphabetical list of all the women covered, with very brief occupational, geographical, and chronological descriptors. Also included in the volume are a glossary and two bibliographies: one of ancient sources and an extensive list of modern sources. Indexes by occupation and cultural identity would be helpful.</p><p>This is an excellent work, providing not only information about the lives of individual women but broad insight into the circumstances surrounding their lives. Much of the information it contains is unique and not included in other reference sources on the Greek and Roman world. Recommended for high-school, public, and academic libraries. <i></i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i></p>Edited by Marjorie Lightman, who has a Ph.D. in ancient history from Rutgers, and Benjamin Lightman, the founder of the Time/Life research library, this contribution to the "Facts on File Library of World History" focuses on women mentioned in classical Greek and Roman historical literature. Each woman in this alphabetical arrangement is clearly identified by her regional affiliation, her time period, and a descriptive classification (e.g., "political power," "reformer," and "ruler"). This makes it easier to distinguish among individuals bearing the same name: there are 15 Cleopatras, eight Julias, and three Clodias among the entries. Many listings are brief or dominated by citations of familial relationships. By contrast, the movers and shakers of Rome's Julio-Claudian period (figures familiar to devotees of the I Claudius television series) receive longer and more detailed treatment. Inexplicably, while some non-Greco-Roman women--including Zenobia, Barsine, and Boudicca--are profiled, others like mathematician Hypathia of Alexandria, physicians Elephantis and Sotira of Greece, and Christian martyr Cecilia of Rome are ignored. Easy to use but limited in scope, this work is recommended only for academic libraries and public libraries where classical studies are popular.<br><i>-Rose M.

Reprint.</p><p>Award-winning novelist of Irish history Thomas Flanagan (The Tenants of Time, 1988, etc.) sets his new novel, as densely packed and relentlessly thorough as usual, in the turbulent 1920's, an era whose legacy lingers today in strife-ridden Northern Ireland. The complex story is told in alternating chapters by such characters as Patrick Prentiss, a barrister who lost his arm fighting for the British in World War I; Janice Nugent, a young Irish widow whose husband died fighting at Gallipoli; Christopher Blake, a historian and soon Janice's lover; and the mysterious Frank Lacy, a ruthless soldier whose bedtime reading is Virgil. As is typical in docufiction, a slew of real characters such as Winston Churchill, Lloyd George, and Eamon De Valera, speaking often in their own words or at least uttering sentiments in keeping with their reputations, make numerous appearances to add gravitas to the narrative. Beginning in the spring of 1918, members of Sinn Fein, survivors of the 1916 Uprising, and supporters of Irish Independence form the Irish Republican Army and begin a war that is fought on all sides with ruthless ferocity. The notorious British ``Black and Tans'' are just as savage as the IRA in mounting ambushes, exacting reprisals, and burning enemy houses. As the war continues, Frank Lacy achieves stunning military successes, Christopher Blake does brilliant intelligence work, while Prentiss and Nugent observe and comment from the sidelines. The story, though, is dominated by the legendary and beloved Michael Collins, a man of a thousand disguises and daring ruses. For signing an accord with Britain in 1921 establishing the Irish Free State, Collins is regarded as a traitor by diehard Republicans and is assassinated. A nasty little war with even nastier consequences, deftly described with enough details to satisfy those who prefer their history lightly spritzed with fiction. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Flanagan fans will delight in this big new novel celebrating Sinn Fein's fight for Irish independence in the early decades of the century. The author's two previous books, The Year of the French and Tenants of Time , traced Irish republicanism from its origins in the unsuccessful 1798 Rebellion though the failed Fenian uprisings of the second half of the 19th century. This narrative focuses on the movement's partial success during the years of guerrilla struggle that first saw the emergence of the IRA, the drama of the peace negotiations with the British and the terrible civil war that followed when the IRA split over the treaty terms. Flanagan offers a rich mix of fictional and historical characters to tell the larger story of that time (and indeed, it is the course of the Troubles themselves that provides the novel's true tensions). The four major fictional characters who carry the narrative accurately reflect Irish attitudes in those years: two are republican activists and two are sympathetic to the cause but ambivalent as to the methods used. The legendary Michael Collins figures prominently, as he did in history, and the portrait of him is riveting. Winston Churchill is tellingly rendered as well, particularly as he plans to infiltrate rebel Dublin with a special secret service unit that was ultimately destroyed by Collins's brilliant counterstroke. This substantive successor to the author's previous work re-creates a complex period of "terrible beauty" in Irish history, a period which set loose forces that still seek a final resolution.

First published in 1987, the book has been rereleased three times, most recently in a twentieth-anniversary edition published in 2007. An essential guide and reference work for divers and shipwreck enthusiasts, with information that is not readily available or only available after searching many reference works or auction catalogs. This book covers the mints, assayers, styles, and types of treasure coins from the period 1536 at the Mexico City Mint until 1773, the end of cob type treasure coins minted at the Potosi Mint. In addition it has a section which goes over each of the most famous treasure wrecks of all time including the Atocha, 1715 Fleet and many others.</p><p>Daniel Frank Sedwick is an specialist in the colonial coinage of Spanish America as well as shipwreck coins and artifacts of all nations. Until early 1996, Daniel Frank Sedwick worked in partnership with the late Dr. Frank Sedwick, who became known as a pioneer in the field of Spanish colonial numismatics with his book The Practical Book of Cobs. The fourth (2007) and third (1995) editions of this well-known book were authored and co-authored by Daniel Frank Sedwick, who is also a contributing editor to The Numismatist (the monthly magazine of the American Numismatic Association) and the author of several articles. Sedwick is a member of the American Numismatic Association and Florida United Numismatists, and holds a Bachelor of Science degree (cum laude) from Duke University.Joe Lasser writes: "Dan Sedwick has produced a fourth edition of "The Practical Book of Cobs". In it he has carefully revised and enlarged assayer descriptions and very importantly for any and all researchers, he explains the rationale for his conclusions. He's added a new section giving a list of fifty five treasure ships and their cargoes and has compressed virtually every important fact known about cobs today into this well structured volume. It is well written -- lucid and logical-- and is a meaningful addition to cob coin literature that should be included in everyone's library. I wish that I could do as good a job as Dan has done." --The E-Sylum: Volume 10, Number 36, September 10, 2007, Article 2<br><br>This popular book has been out of print since 1995 and unavailable for a number of years now, so this [fourth] edition should be a most welcome addition to the market! Greatly expanded from the previous edition (more than 100 pages longer!), this 20th Anniversary Edition contains a long new section on the shipwrecks that have yielded cobs over the years, complete with a foldout map and specified bibliographies for each wreck. Also, the assayer section incorporates the latest research information, with specimen photos of most of the assayers (not separated into a photo section as before). The values in the back, of course, have been updated. What has not changed, however, is the appeal to both beginners and advanced collectors alike, as well as dealers and jewelers who work with cobs. The Practical Book of Cobs offers readers a look at the following topics: Historical background / Elements of design / Market values / Extensive bibliography / Complete ID of mint marks, assayers, and period / How cobs were made and used / Treasure Fleets and other shipwrecks that produced cobs / How to buy and sell, and how to spot counterfeits. --PLUS ULTRA NEWSLETTER: ENRADA PUBLICATIONS: October 2007</p><h2>Encyclopedia of the Renaissance</h2><p>Encyclopedia of the Renaissance (6 Volume Set)</p><p><i>Encyclopedia of the Renaissance</i> is the most recent publication in Scribner's world history program, which includes <i>Dictionary of the Middle Ages</i> (1982-89), <i>Civilization of the Ancient Mediterranean</i> (1988), and <i>Civilizations of the Ancient Near East </i>(1995), a Dartmouth Medal winner. Following the model of its predecessors and its editor's "broad vision" for the work, <i>Encyclopedia of the Renaissance</i> <i>(ER) </i>successfully draws together articles on "the entire cultural movement and period of history called the Renaissance." The first comprehensive, multivolume encyclopedia on the topic, <i>ER</i> is intended to be useful to a variety of readers, including high-school students and general readers, college students, and scholars exploring topics outside their own areas of specialization.<p><i>ER</i> was published in association with the Renaissance Society of America, "the leading organization in the Americas for the interdisciplinary study of the late medieval, Renaissance and early modern period" and publisher of <i>Renaissance Quarterly. </i> The editor in chief is Paul F. Grendler, author of several books on printing and publishing during the period. Grendler was assisted by 12 associate and 2 consulting editors, all from departments of history, art, language, philosophy, Judaica, or Renaissance studies in major universities in the U.S. and Canada. <i>ER</i> contains 1,200 alphabetically arranged, signed articles written by 683 scholars, whose affiliations are listed in the last volume of the set. Approximately three-quarters of the contributors are from academic institutions, museums, or libraries in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the remaining contributors are from similar institutions in Australia, Europe, Israel, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>In his introduction, Grendler provides a working definition of the Renaissance as "a series of intellectual, artistic, political, and social initiatives that began in Italy around 1350 [and] spread to the rest of Europe and to the wider world. These innovations had an enduring influence on modern civilization. The humanists and other men and women of the era believed that they were giving birth to a new age. They called it a renaissance, because they saw their own age as a rebirth of the best of the ancient world." Like <i>Dictionary of the Middle Ages</i>, the articles in <i>ER </i>address all aspects of life during the period, including the arts, culture, economics, humanism, literature, philosophy, politics, religion, science, social history, and women's roles. The set also includes biographies of about 600 individuals and 26 families (e.g., <i>Habsburg dynasty; Medici</i>,<i> House of</i>). Chronological coverage "begins in Italy in approximately 1350, then broadens geographically to embrace the rest of Europe in the middle to late fifteenth century," ending in the mid-seventeenth century, when "transformations of various monarchies . . . ushered in a new period in European political history." The geographic scope includes all of Europe and "also the larger world as Europeans encountered it through exploration, trade, and colonization."</p><p>Articles range from <i>Absolutism</i> to <i>Zoology</i>, encompassing subjects as varied as <i>Alchemy</i>, <i>Food and drink</i>, <i>Grand tour</i>, <i>Piracy</i>, <i>Printing and publishing</i>, and <i>Tournaments</i>. Length is from one-half page (many of the biographies) to nearly 50 pages (<i>Renaissance</i>). Longer, composite entries (<i>Art</i>, <i>Drama, Renaissance</i>) group together more specialized, related articles, each with its own heading and occasionally separate authors and bibliographies. For example, <i>Renaissance</i> includes "The Renaissance in Historical Thought," "The English Renaissance in Literary Interpretation," "The Renaissance in Popular Imagination," "Influence of the Renaissance," and "Renaissance Studies."</p><p>Articles sampled were well-written, authoritative, and generally fascinating, offering a unique focus on topics that can be found in general or specialized encyclopedias (e.g., <i>Espionage</i>, <i>Popular culture</i>, <i>Prostitution</i>, <i>Sports</i>). Many include features that contribute to their clarity and appeal to a diverse audience; for example, they usually begin with clear definitions of their topics. <i>Piracy</i> is "larceny on or by descent from the sea"; and <i>Pilgrimage</i> is a "physical journey from a person's normal residence to a site that the person considers sacred." Articles longer than a page or two include boldface subheadings that make it easy to pick out items of interest. For example, <i>Plague</i> includes headings enabling readers to pinpoint discussions of recurrent plague and the history of disease, demographic studies of recurrent plague, and plague and public health. A number of articles include a final section placing the topic in the context of the Renaissance, especially if the connection is not obvious. <i>Plague </i>includes a section entitled "Social and Cultural History of Plague in the Renaissance"; <i>Arms and armor</i> includes a discussion of "The Role of Arms and Armor in Renaissance Society." Many treatments are surprisingly and deliciously contemporary, including a list of film versions of Shakespeare's plays and discussion of the use of the term "Renaissance Man" as a selling point in personal ads (both found in "The Renaissance in Popular Imagination" section within the <i>Renaissance</i> article). With a few dry exceptions, writing strikes a careful balance between scholarly and breezy style. The set is irresistibly conducive to browsing, and quotable passages continued to surface during review, such as the revelation that the word <i>quarantine</i> comes from the practice of requiring a waiting period of 40 days for foreign ships arriving at the port of Ragusa, Italy, to see if any of the passengers developed plague symptoms (<i>Plague</i>); or the fact that the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra was held hostage by pirates from 1575 to 1580 (<i>Piracy</i>). Cross-references direct readers to related entries.</p><p>Selective bibliographies complete each article. When appropriate, bibliographies are divided according to primary sources, secondary sources, and topics. Primary sources are usually modern editions in original languages or English translation. Secondary sources include "the most important scholarly works in any language, plus the most useful works in English." Most sources are in English or western European languages and published in the 1970s through the late 1990s. There are also older classics and a relatively small number of periodical articles. Some articles include references within the text. Inexplicably, some bibliographies are annotated, while others are not, and publishers' names are not included in the citations</p><p>The Board noticed a few flaws, such as the failure of the section "Women Artists" within the article <i>Art</i> to mention the important painter Artemesia Gentileschi or refer to the biographical entry on her, although she is in the public eye as the subject of several recent books, articles in magazines like <i>Newsweek</i>, and a catalogue raisonnepublished by Penn State University Press. The generally excellent article <i>Piracy</i> refers to "Barbary corsairs" without explaining the difference between <i>corsairs</i> and <i>pirates</i>; the same article refers to an intriguing "Black Legend" without explaining it.</p><p><i>ER </i>includes 750 black-and-white illustrations. In many cases, Renaissance artwork illustrates topical entries. For example, Albrecht Durer's famous engraving of a rhinoceros illustrates <i>Zoology</i>, and a "sixteenth century depiction of women of the street and a pimp" from the Musee d'Art et d'Histoire in Geneva enlivens <i>Prostitution.</i> Each volume also includes a color frontispiece and an eight-page insert of full-color, captioned illustrations. Thirty-five crisply delineated maps include countries, cities, and regions, such as Burgundy. Other features include a chronology, which extends from 1300 to 1724. A "Topical Outline of Contents" lists articles according to a conceptual framework divided into "Contexts," "Thought," "Art," "Literature," "Places," "Events," "Biographies," and "Study of the Renaissance." Each of these categories is further divided, with individual articles listed under each subdivision. The topical outline provides readers with yet another mechanism for locating related articles.</p><p>There are a number of one-volume reference sources on the Renaissance, including <i>Cultural Atlas of the Renaissance</i> (Prentice Hall, 1993) and <i>Encyclopedia of the Renaissance</i> (Facts On File, 1987). Although these titles may remain the only option for very small collections, <i>ER </i>goes far beyond them in scope, length of articles, and the comprehensiveness of its interdisciplinary approach. It is an essential purchase for all academic libraries, larger public libraries, art collections, and libraries of high schools with strong programs in history and art. <i></i></p>This new six-volume reference work will prove to be an indispensable resource on any topic imaginable (from cooking methods to midwifery) in Renaissance studies. Grendler (history, Univ. of Toronto) has assembled nearly 1200 clearly written articles of varying length by over 600 international contributors. Designed to be of use to both student and scholar, the articles cover the period from approximately 1350 to the eve of the 30 Years' War in 1618, treating the Renaissance as both a specific period in history and as a cultural movement. Editor Grendler believes that the Renaissance was marked by great social and cultural unity within Europe, a unity that Europeans would not experience again until the late 20th century. The articles reflect three modern trends in Renaissance studies: a recognition of the humanism that underlay the informed thought of the period, a close look at the fundamental social conditions of all classes of Renaissance society, and a consideration of women's roles during the Renaissance. Each alphabetically arranged entry includes a bibliography, and an index and chronology are included. One color plate is found at the beginning of each volume, while the rest of the 750 illustrations are in black and white. Although expensive, this reference will serve lay readers, students, and scholars. Highly recommended for academic libraries with significant holdings in Renaissance history and for larger public libraries [See also "Best Reference Sources 1999," p. 54.--Ed.].--Robert J.

Mount Misery is a prestigious facility set in the rolling green hills of New England, its country club atmosphere maintained by generous corporate contributions. Dr. Roy Basch (hero of The House of God) is lucky enough to train there *only to discover doctors caught up in the circus of competing psychiatric theories, and patients who are often there for one main reason: they've got good insurance.<br>From the Laws of Mount Misery:<br><br>Your colleagues will hurt you more than your patients.<br><br>On rounds at Mount Misery, it's not always easy for Basch to tell the patients from the doctors: Errol Cabot, the drug cowboy whose practice provides him with guinea pigs for his imaginative prescription cocktails . . . Blair Heiler, the world expert on borderlines (a diagnosis that applies to just about everybody) . . . A. K. Lowell, n�e Aliyah K. Lowenschteiner, whose Freudian analytic technique is so razor sharp it prohibits her from actually speaking to patients . . . And Schlomo Dove, the loony, outlandish shrink accused of having sex with a beautiful, well-to-do female patient.<br>From the Laws of Mount Misery:<br><br>Psychiatrists specialize in their defects. <br><br>For Basch the practice of psychiatry soon becomes a nightmare in which psychiatrists compete with one another to find the best ways to reduce human beings to blubbering drug-addled pods, or incite them to an extreme where excessive rage is the only rational response, or tie them up in Freudian knots. And all the while, the doctors seem less interested in their patients' mental health than in a host of other things *managed care insurance money, drug company research grants and kickbacks, and their own professional advancement.<br>From the Laws of Mount Misery:<br><br>In psychiatry, first comes treatment, then comes diagnosis.<br><br>What The House of God did for doctoring the body, Mount Misery does for doctoring the mind. A practicing psychiatrist, Samuel Shem brings vivid authenticity and extraordinary storytelling gifts to this long-awaited sequel, to create a novel that is laugh-out-loud hilarious, terrifying, and provocative. Filled with biting irony and a wonderful sense of the absurd, Mount Misery tells you everything you'll never learn in therapy. And it's a hell of a lot funnier.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Anyone who has read Samuel Shem's previous novel, <i>The House of God</i>, will be familiar with Dr. Roy Basch, the protagonist of <i>Mount Misery</i>. When last seen, Dr. Basch was completing a grueling residency; <i>Mount Misery</i> finds him beginning his psychiatric training at an upscale New England mental hospital. His introduction to the myriad forms of therapy available today--everything from Freudian psychoanalysis to psychopharmacology--provides Mr. Shem with plenty of blackly humorous grist for his mill. In this hospital, apparently, you need a score card to tell the doctors from the patients. <p> Shem (the pseudonym of psychiatrist and playwright Dr. Stephen Bergman) delights in broad parody. He creates, for example, characters such as Dr. Heiler who gives lectures entitled "Borderline Germans and German Borderlines," or Dr. A. K. Lowell, whose devotion to Freudian analysis is so extreme that she refuses to speak to patients at all. Though the humor can be clumsy at times, Shem makes some serious points about the perils of psychotherapy in which the therapist is not above reproach.</p>"MOUNT MISERY is outrageously funny, a sage and important novel by a healer and a Shakespearean."<br>--The Boston Globe<br><br>"AN ENGROSSING READ . . . DARKLY ENTERTAINING . . . <br>Welcome to Mount Misery psychiatric hospital, home of the crazed, the suicidal, the Machiavellian, and the wicked.

Few poets have inhabited the land of old age as long or energetically as Milosz, for whom this territory holds both openings and closings, affirmations as well as losses. "Not soon, as late as the approach of my ninetieth year, / I felt a door opening in me and I entered / the clarity of early morning," he writes in "Late Ripeness." Elsewhere he laments the loss of his voracious vision -- "My wondrously quick eyes, you saw many things, / Lands and cities, islands and oceans" -- only to discover a new light that defies the limits of physical sight: "Without eyes, my gaze is fixed on one bright point, / That grows large and takes me in."</p><p><em>Second Space</em> is typically capacious in the range of voices, forms, and subjects it embraces. It moves seamlessly from dramatic monologues to theological treatises, from philosophy and history to epigrams, elegies, and metaphysical meditations. It is unified by Milosz's ongoing quest to find the bond linking the things of this world with the order of a "second space," shaped not by necessity, but grace. <em>Second Space</em> invites us to accompany a self-proclaimed "apprentice" on this extraordinary quest. In "Treatise on Theology," Milosz calls himself "a one day's master." He is, of course, far more than this. <em>Second Space</em> reveals an artist peerless both in his capacity to confront the world's suffering and in his eagerness to embrace its joys: "Sun. And sky. And in the sky white clouds. / Only now everything cried to him: Eurydice! / How will I live without you, my consoling one! / But there was a fragrant scent of herbs, the low humming of bees, / And he fell asleep with his cheek on the sun-warmed earth."</p></p><p><p>Czeslaw Milosz was born in Szetejnie, Lithuania, in 1911. He worked with the Polish resistance movement in Warsaw during World War II and was later stationed in Paris and Washington, D.C., as a Polish cultural attach�. He defected to France in 1951, and in 1960 he accepted a position at the University of California, Berkeley. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980, and was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He died in 2004.</p>The title's second space comprises heaven and hell, which have "vanished forever"; without them the blessed cannot "meet salvation" and the damned "find suitable quarters." In mourning, the poet exhorts: "Let us implore that it be returned to us,/ That second space." The Nobel laureate, who died this past summer in Krak�w at 93, is preoccupied in this collection with establishing that space through words, but also finds it in carnality and in "the unattainable Now." The opening section of summative short lyrics on themes familiar from late Milosz (memory, salvation, place) is followed by four long poems. "Father Severinus" is an eponymous 11-poem dramatic monologue of a priest (who shares one of the names of medieval philosopher Boethius) in whom there is "only a hope of hope." Next comes "Treatise on Theology" ("A young man couldn't write a treatise like this,/ Though I don't think it is dictated by fear of death"), followed by "Apprentice," a beautiful autobiography in verse (with extensive prose annotations by Milosz) and finally a stunning, short "Orpheus and Eurydice": "His lyre was silent and in his dream he was defenseless./ He knew he must have faith and he could not have faith./ And so he would persist, for a very long time,/ Counting his steps in a half-wakeful torpor." The terrors, torpors and partial redemptions of this collection feel wholly earned. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

[and] demonstrated the power of the common people in a manner which no subsequent government has ever allowed itself to forget."<br> We can learn a great deal from studying the French Revolution itself, but we can also learn from studying the ways in which scholars have interpreted the French Revolution, and from the ways their views have changed. For over a century following the Revolution, commentators and scholars spoke of it in glowing terms. But in the past three decades, revisionist historians have become skeptical. Eric Hobsbawm reiterates the centrality of the Revolution for history on a global basis. He argues that those who wrote about the Revolution in the nineteenth century were convinced it had changed their lives dramatically, improving the economy and the lot of peasants. They saw the Revolution as a prototype of of the bourgeois revolution, enabling the middle class to gain power from the ruling class of aristocrats. Many believed proletarian revolutions would inevitably follow. In the years between 1917 and the 1960s, Marxists continued to use the French Revolution as a point of reference, paying increasing attention to the social and economic factors in the Revolution, not only to the political factors. In the 1970s and 1980s, many historians began to argue that the Revolution achieved modest results at disproportionate costs. Hobsbawm argues that this massive historiographical reaction against the centrality of the Revolution reflects the personal politics of those contemporary historians for whom Marxism and communism are now out of favor. They are, he maintains, wrong. The Revolution transformed the world permanently and introduced forces that continue to transform it.</p><p>Eric Hobsbawm is a neo-Marxist historian of the Industrial Revolution who pays particular attention to the inequities toward the lower classes, especially in law and politics."It is good to rub the revisionist sand from one's eyes and read: 'The absurdity of the assumption that the French Revolution is simply a sort of stumble on the long, slow march of eternal France, is patent.' Eric Hobsbawm is right, of course" (Gwynne Lewis <i>author of "The French Revolution" and "Life in Revolutionary France"</i>)<br><br>"This is a vigorous, refreshing, and learned brief on behalf of a venerable historiographical tradition. It reminds us of the obvious but often overlooked truth: that there are no definitive interpretations, certainly not of an event so primal and transcendent as the French Revolution." (David P. Jordan <i>author of "The Revolutionary Career of Maximilien Robespierre"</i>)<br><br>"Nobody is better qualified to explore such a theme, for the range and penetration of Hobsbawm's writings on modern European history have long been the envy and admiration of other scholars" (William Doyle <i>author of "The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction"</i>)</p><h2>Stravaganza: City of Swords</h2><p><p>When a talisman transports her to the Talian city of Fortezza, Laura finds herself falling in love with a young Talian man named Ludo. But soon a rivalry erupts between two factions in Fortezza, and Laura and Ludo find themselves on opposite sides!

Sanders??'s view of Paul, in order to point the way beyond the polarization of "new" and "old" perspectives on the apostle. <p>The Paul who comes to light in these pages is agent and thinker, apostle and theologian. He is a highly contextual figure, yet his account of Christian identity continues to shape the church's life to this day. He is the founder of mainly Gentile, Christ-believing communities, separated from the synagogue; and yet he can see this distinctive existence as an authentic response to Jewish scripture and tradition, as fulfilled in Christ. He is a many-sided figure, transcending all our attempts to categorize him or to co-opt him for our own favored causes.</p></p><p>Francis Watson holds a research chair in biblical interpretation at Durham University, England. Well known for his work in both theological interpretation and Pauline studies, he is also the author of <i>Paul and the Hermeneutics of Faith.</i><b>J. Ross Wagner</b><br> &#x2014; Princeton Theological Seminary<br> "Like a fine wine, Francis Watson's insightful early work on Paul has aged well, retaining its fundamental character while acquiring new depths of subtlety, complexity, and maturity. Watson moves beyond the tired dogmas of 'old' and 'new' perspectives alike, blending historical, sociological, and theological approaches to offer a richly textured account of Paul and his gospel that significantly advances the discussion even as it provokes important new questions for future research."<br><br><b>Douglas Campbell</b><br> &#x2014; Duke Divinity School<br> "Here we return to Watson's brilliant suggestion in 1986 that Paul's justification texts and arguments can only be comprehended as they are located in their underlying missiological and sociological dynamics &#x2014; in particular, in the radical sectarian break made by the apostle's churches away from orthopractic Judaism. Updated, and with links to his other important works explained, the result is vintage Watson &#x2014; a series of creative if not provocative theses, argued combatively, with enviable clarity, and with impressive learning."</p><h2>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</h2><p><b>"Morpurgo's sprightly writing brings out all the humor as well as the horror of the original tale, and Foreman's profuse, evocative watercolor-and-pastel illustrations highlight the drama in each scene." &#x2014; SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL (starred review)</b><br><br>Think yourself back in years, my friends. . . .<br><br>It's New Year's Eve in Camelot, where King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, and all their good Knights wait breathlessly for an extravagant feast to begin. Suddenly, a strange and frightening Knight bursts into the hall &#x2014; a giant of a man, green from head to toe, who mockingly challenges the Court to a shocking game. Only the chivalrous Sir Gawain dares to take on the hideous Green Knight. But over the unexpected course of his test,<br>will Gawain prove as brave and honest as he'd like to believe? Welcome to a medieval world full of sword fights and shape-shifting, monsters and magic, and timeless characters both gallant and wonderfully human. Written anonymously in the fourteenth century, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is retold in its entirety by Michael Morpurgo in a lively and accessible narration that captures all the tale's drama and humor. Vivid illustrations by the celebrated Michael Foreman infuse this classic tale with the sights and colors of dragons, swords, and medieval pageantry.</p><p>Michael Morpurgo is the author of more than ninety books, many of which have been adapted for film and television. He has won numerous prizes and awards for his work, including the Smarties Book Prize, the Writer's Guild Award, and both the Whitbread Award and Children�s Book Award for his novel THE WRECK OF THE ZANZIBAR. In 2003 he was appointed the third Children's Laureate, a position he founded with the poet Ted Hughes. He lives in Devon, England.<br><br>Michael Foreman is one of the world's leading children�s book illustrators. He has written and illustrated numerous books and has won many major awards, including the Kate Greenaway Medal, the Kurt Maschler Award, and the Bologna Graphics Prize. Among his many picture books are HELLO WORLD, A TRIP TO DINOSAUR TIME, and MICHAEL FOREMAN'S PLAYTIME RHYMES. He lives in London.*Starred Review* Gr. 4-7. In this handsome volume, Morpurgo ably translates one of medieval England's greatest tales from verse into modern prose. When a bold giant, the Green Knight, challenges King Arthur's court to a contest that involves beheading, only one knight, Sir Gawain, steps between his king and the giant's battle-ax. Gawain, Arthur's nephew and one of his most courageous, virtuous, and beloved knights, travels through the wilds of the kingdom, testing his mettle against an ogre, a dragon, and a pack of wolves before he arrives at a castle. There the lord welcomes him like a brother and the lord's lady woos him, making advances that Gawain finds increasingly hard to resist. In the climactic meeting with the Green Knight, Gawain learns that the contest was not a trial of strength but of honor. Morpurgo has not neglected the underpinnings of knightly conduct, courtly love, and Christian virtue that are a vital part of the original, but children will read this story for the adventure--and what an adventure it is! Morpurgo's dramatic telling captures the vitality of the tale as well as its beauty and mystery. Foreman illuminates the book with watercolor-and-pastel illustrations that are true to the story, full of energy, and aglow with colors that are sometimes subdued and sometimes fiery bright. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I had been padding very quietly down a corridor that wasn&#x2019;t on any plan, in a building that didn&#x2019;t officially exist, and the last thing I expected was to hear my name spoken aloud by a voice I was almost sure I recognised. I stopped and looked quickly about me. I was half-way down a long, unlit hallway, heavy with shadows, with not a light on anywhere in the dozen or so adjoining offices. I was completely alone.</p><p>I knew that, because I&#x2019;d gone to great pains and trouble to make sure of it. Because if the Vatican Security Forces ever found a Drood field agent operating anywhere inside the bounds of the holy city, they would quite definitely never forgive me. The Church might have made occasional use of the Droods down the centuries but has never trusted my family an inch. And I think it is only fair to say, vice versa.</p><p>The corridor was so dark I could only just make out its far end, but I was positive there wasn&#x2019;t another soul anywhere near me. The deep shadows lay undisturbed, and it was so quiet all I could hear was my own slow, controlled breathing. And then the Merlin Glass shot up out of my pocket to hang on the air right in front of my face. I didn&#x2019;t quite jump out of my skin, and I didn&#x2019;t actually make the strangulated scream I very much wanted to, but I did regard the hand mirror hovering before me with more than usual interest. Because if your very secret mission has just been utterly compromised and is now lying tits up in the gutter, you might as well enjoy it.</p><p>The sorcerer Merlin Satanspawn&#x2014;and yes, I do mean the one you&#x2019;re thinking of&#x2014;had made a present of the Glass to my family some fifteen hundred years ago. We&#x2019;re still trying to decide whether that was a kindly act or not. Ever since the Merlin Glass fell into my hands, not that long ago, it has proved itself to be highly useful, intensely irritating, and constantly surprising. Not least because I can never lay my hand on the operating manual when I need it.</p><p>The Glass looks like a perfectly ordinary hand mirror, with a chased silver handle and back. It can show me views of anywhere on Earth, and grow into a dimensional Doorway big enough to take me there. I&#x2019;d grown used to that. But I wasn&#x2019;t at all used to seeing my reflection vanish from the mirror and be replaced by the shifty features of the notorious Harry Fabulous.</p><p>I grabbed the mirror by its handle and pulled it close to my face. A pale yellow light was spilling out of the Glass from wherever Harry was, and I didn&#x2019;t want it to attract unnecessary attention. I was almost out of this very secret part of the Vatican, but <i>almost</i> isn&#x2019;t <i>is</i>. Burglars should not hang around at the scenes of their crimes, not if they want to grow up to be very old burglars&#x2014;particularly if the local security forces are authorised to use extreme and distressing levels of violence. But Harry Fabulous had got my attention. No one had ever used the mysterious Merlin Glass as a mobile phone before. I hadn&#x2019;t even known that was possible.</p><p>I tried the door handle on the nearest office, and it turned easily in my grasp. I pushed the door open and slipped silently into the darkened room, pulling the door almost but not completely shut after me. Just in case I needed to make a sudden and hurried exit. The pale yellow light from the hand mirror showed me the rough outlines of furniture and filing cabinets, and not much else. I looked into the Merlin Glass and gave Harry Fabulous my best intimidating glare.</p><p>&#x201c;This had better be important, Harry,&#x201d; I said quietly. &#x201c;I am rather busy just at the moment. How did you get this number, anyway?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Trust me; this is really very important, Eddie,&#x201d; said Harry, smiling nervously. &#x201c;And I mean seriously important, with a heaping side order of urgent. As to how I was able to tap into the Merlin Glass, you really don&#x2019;t want to know. It would only keep you up nights.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no point in pressing Harry. If he wasn&#x2019;t prepared to give up his source, it was only because he was more scared of whomever he was working for than he was of me. Mind you, Harry Fabulous was scared of a great many people and things, usually with good reason. Harry is a creature of the shadows, or at least those very grey areas where Law and Morality and Good Sense are only passing things. Harry is a master of the illegal deal, the crafty con, and the kind of borderline business agreement you just know you&#x2019;ll end up regretting later. Harry Fabulous is your go-to guy for all the things you&#x2019;re not supposed to want, all the things that are supposed to be impossible to get. Whether it&#x2019;s a drug or a dream, a girl or a grimoire, a memory from yesterday or a promise of tomorrow, Harry has sources. He can get you anything, for the right price.</p><p>He&#x2019;s not much to look at, but then his kind never is. In his business, it&#x2019;s never a good idea to stand out from the crowd. A shabby man in shabby clothes, with a hard-worn face and unreadable eyes, Harry always said he could run a game on God, and be well out of town before the penny dropped. But then something went horribly wrong for Harry Fabulous, in a secret back room in one of those very private Members Only clubs well off the main drag in the Nightside&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And now Harry leads a desperate life of penance and atonement, to make up for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever it was he did. Doing good deeds, for the good of his soul. Before it&#x2019;s too late. He hustles around, happy to be helpful to all the right people, mediating between people and groups who couldn&#x2019;t otherwise talk to one another.</p><p>Harry Fabulous wouldn&#x2019;t normally say boo to a Drood, so for him to contact me at all was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. interesting.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want, Harry?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And can&#x2019;t it wait till I&#x2019;ve broken out of the Vatican?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not really, no,&#x201d; said Harry. &#x201c;I have a client in desperate need of your help. As in right now!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep your voice down!&#x201d; I said, glancing quickly out through the crack at the door. The corridor still looked empty, but I wasn&#x2019;t as convinced of that as I had been. I couldn&#x2019;t shake off the feeling that something was creeping up on me. And not in a good way.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing in the Vatican, Eddie?&#x201d; said Harry.</p><p>&#x201c;I could tell you,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but then I&#x2019;d have to exorcise you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, Eddie, you know me,&#x201d; said Harry. &#x201c;I am the soul of discretion. Mostly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do know you, Harry Fabulous,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;and I would not trust you as far as I could throw a wet camel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lot of people say that,&#x201d; Harry said sadly.</p><p>&#x201c;Can we please get on with this? I am rather in the middle of something here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doing what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something I am entirely sure both my family and all the Powers That Be at the Vatican would not want you to know about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fair enough,&#x201d; said Harry. &#x201c;I currently represent the management of the Wulfshead Club. And no, I don&#x2019;t have a clue who they are, just like everyone else, so there&#x2019;s no point in asking me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then how do you know it&#x2019;s really them?&#x201d; I said craftily.</p><p>&#x201c;They were very convincing,&#x201d; said Harry. &#x201c;I still get the shakes when I think about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come straight to the Wulfshead, as soon as I&#x2019;m outside the Vatican buildings.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Harry said quickly. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t! The club&#x2019;s new privacy shields don&#x2019;t allow anyone to teleport in. Even the mighty Merlin Glass would bump its nose. I&#x2019;ll meet you in the alley outside the main London entrance. As soon as you can, Eddie. Please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Give me ten minutes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Unless I run into Security&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then make it fifteen minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>Harry&#x2019;s face disappeared from the Merlin Glass, replaced by my own reflection. Even in the dim light of the empty office, I thought I looked tired and hard done by. As one of the most secret of the hidden world&#x2019;s secret agents, I go to a lot of trouble to appear ordinary and anonymous, but people like Harry Fabulous put years on me. I would have preferred for him to hang around just a little longer, to answer a few pointed questions about exactly why I was needed so urgently, but that was probably why he&#x2019;d disappeared so quickly. I slipped the Merlin Glass back into my pocket and stood still for a moment, thinking.</p><p>I knew all about the Wulfshead Club. Everyone in my line of work does. A very private drinking establishment, for very private people. A covert bolt-hole, for those of us who operate in the hidden world. The Good, the Bad, and the In-between are always welcome, as long as they&#x2019;ve got money to spend. More importantly, it&#x2019;s neutral ground for those of us who feel the need for somewhere safe and secure to let our hair down. Many of us who work in the supernatural Intelligence community tend to end up there. If only because we all need someone we can talk to, about the things we&#x2019;ve seen and the things we&#x2019;ve done, who won&#x2019;t judge us. The kinds of things only people like us ever get to know about.</p><p>The world doesn&#x2019;t need to know. It would only worry.</p><p>There are a great many secret entrances to the Wulfshead Club, in any number of cities, scattered around the world. Though getting in, or out, can be murder. The club&#x2019;s been around for as long as anyone can remember, in one form or another, but no one knows for sure who owns and runs it. Despite a clientele who make their business digging out answers, the Wulfshead&#x2019;s management remains determinedly anonymous. And they have never, ever, asked a member of my family for help before. I had to smile. This was just too good to turn down.</p><p>My head came up sharply as I heard soft running footsteps outside the office, approaching rapidly from the far end of the corridor. Not good. Not in any way good. I couldn&#x2019;t use the Merlin Glass to teleport out until I was completely outside the building and back in the official world.</p><p>I pulled the door open and slipped back out into the corridor, not making a sound. When you&#x2019;re a field agent for the Droods, moving unseen and unobserved comes as standard. I glared into the gloom at the far end of the corridor, back the way I&#x2019;d come, and could just make out a number of dark, indistinct figures heading my way at more than human speed. Charging down the corridor, they shifted their shapes subtly as they moved. I couldn&#x2019;t hear any bells or sirens; the advancing shapes were doing nothing to raise the alarm. Presumably they intended to bring me down before anyone else found out I was ever there. I had to smile. Being chased by a small army of angry priests and warrior nuns was probably every good Catholic boy&#x2019;s worst nightmare. Good thing I was raised Church of England.</p><p>I ran down the corridor at full pelt, not even trying to be quiet or unobserved any more. My feet hammered on the floor, and my arms pumped at my sides as I made good speed, leaving my pursuers behind. I was still hoping to make my escape without having to fight my way out. I didn&#x2019;t want to make more of a fuss than was necessary. Scrapping with priests and nuns inside the Vatican, even the parts that don&#x2019;t officially exist, is never going to be profitable. And I really didn&#x2019;t want the Vatican Security Forces to even suspect they&#x2019;d had a Drood in the house. Which was why I hadn&#x2019;t raised my incredible Drood armour. Just the presence of so much golden strange matter in the holy city would set off every alarm they had and bring everyone running at once.</p><p>I risked a glance back over my shoulder. My pursuers were catching up fast, moving so quietly now that their feet didn&#x2019;t even seem to be brushing the bare wooden floor. I could see robes and wimples, but no faces. Even as I looked, though, the dark shapes changed, flowing like water. Legs and arms lengthened, backs became hunched, and great black membranous wings stretched out, their tips brushing against the corridor walls, beating loudly on the still air. The whole atmosphere in the corridor changed, becoming horrid and oppressive. There was a sudden stench of blood and brimstone. It seemed the rumours were true, after all. The Vatican had contracted out for its most secret security forces, drawing on denizens from the Lower Reaches. The remote activating of the Merlin Glass must have alerted them to my presence.</p><p>I was in real trouble now.</p><p>I pounded down the corridor, forcing the last bit of speed out of my aching muscles. It had been a long night, and I&#x2019;m not really built for running. I could hear my breathing coming fast and hard, and my heart was hammering in my chest. I finally reached the door at the far end, skidded to a halt, and rattled the handle. It was locked. Of course it was; it was that kind of night. I grabbed a handy piece of heavy marble statuary from its niche (almost certainly centuries old, and valuable beyond price) and used it to smash the lock. The statue came to pieces in my hand, but the door jumped open. I threw the pieces aside and charged through the opening. I didn&#x2019;t dare look back. I could hear the flapping of huge wings right behind me, like wet blankets on the air.</p><p>Outside, an old-fashioned black iron fire escape clung precariously to the ancient stone wall. I hurried up the steps, heading for the roof. Having to pass through the door one at a time should slow my pursuers down nicely, especially if they stopped to argue over who had precedence. I hauled myself up the shaking metal rungs, making a hell of a racket, grabbing at the railings with both hands to hurry myself along. I made it onto the slanting tile roof and then stopped to get my breath and my bearings.</p><p>I could hear heavy things hammering up the fire escape, their combined weight almost pulling the metal stairs away from the side of the building. I didn&#x2019;t look. I didn&#x2019;t want to see, didn&#x2019;t want to know. I could hear angry buzzing voices, only just trying to be human, saying bad things. I went to stand on the very edge of the roof, planting one foot on the iron guttering, and looked out over the view below.</p><p>It was a hell of a long drop down to the ground below. Hundreds of feet, at least. But I could see the whole of the holy city stretched out before me, the great white buildings glowing and gleaming in the fierce moonlight. You get to see some of the best views in the world in my job. Though mostly not for very long.</p><p>I took out the Merlin Glass, shook it till it was the size of a Door, and then gave it the correct Space Time coordinates and threw it off the edge of the roof. The Glass fell away into the moonlight, an open Door full of the bright lights of London. I took a deep breath and jumped off the roof after it.</p><p>I heard a roar of frustrated buzzing voices rush by behind me, but I didn&#x2019;t look back at the fire escape. Some things you just don&#x2019;t want to see. I went hurtling down, gathering speed all the time, the ground rushing up to greet me. Cool evening air battered at my face and tugged at my clothes. The fall would be more than enough to kill any ordinary man. Good thing I was a Drood. I subvocalised the activating Words, and the golden armour contained in the torc at my throat rushed out to cover me from head to toe in a moment.</p><p>I could hear flapping heavy wings beh...</p></p><h2>Collected Writings of John Murray (Volume 3)</h2><p>Since the publication of volumes one and two of the Collected Writings of John Murray, this third volume in the series has been eagerly awaited. As promised, it contains an extensive account of Murray's life and the first published collection of his sermons. Added to these are the penetrating and valuable book reviews which he contributed to The Westminister Theological Journal during the period 1939-1953. Iain H. Murray's biography of John Murray traces his life fom his boyhood days in the north of Scotland at the turn of the century, through the First World War (in which he suffered the loss of one eye), his theological training at Princeton and his long ministry as a Seminary Professor in Philadelphia, until his retirement, his return to his native Scotland, and his late marriage and brief period of fatherhood. The biography closes with a moving account of his last days during the early months of 1974.<br>Preaching was never merely an adjunct to Murray's work. On the contrary it was,for him, the reason why the teaching of theology exists. By his own example as a preacher he showed how all the great peaks and valleys of divine revelation are intended 'to lead needy men and women into the riches of God's counsel'. His sermons, including examples of his brief 'table addresses' given at communion services, exhibit the wonderful balance between profound theology and personal devotion to Christ as Saviour and Lord in which he passionately believed.<br><br>As Professor of Systematic Theology at Westminister Seminary, John Murray reviewed some of the most significant theological works for the Seminary's Journal. Not only did he provide critiques of many books, but at the same time he engaged in a dialogue with them which evoked his own insights and expositions of biblical truth. This quality gives his reviews (like those of his predecessor in the Princeton tradition, B.B Warfield) a permanent value.<br><br>Volume 3 of Murray's Collected Writings brings to the reader both the story of his life and some of the choicest fruit of his ministry.</p><p>Professor John Murray (1898-1975) was recognized in his own lifetime as one of the leading Reformed theologians in the English-speaking world. Born at Migdale, near Bonar Bridge, Scotland, he attended Dornoch Academy, and served with the Royal Highlanders (Black Watch) in France during the First World War, losing an eye in the conflict. After the War, he pursued studies, first at the University of Glasgow (MA, 1923), and then at Princeton Theological Seminary, USA (1924-27). In 1929 he was invited to teach Systematic Theology at Princeton, and did so for one year, before joining the Faculty of the newly formed Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. There he shared with such scholars and Christian leaders as J. Gresham Machen and Cornelius Van Til in the great struggle to maintain the old Princeton tradition in theology, represented by the Hodges and B. B. Warfield. He was ordained in 1937 by the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, USA. John Murray remained at Westminster until his retirement in 1966. He returned to his native Scotland, married Valerie Knowlton in December 1967 and enjoyed a brief period of fatherhood prior to his death in 1975. A careful scholar, an eloquent lecturer, a moving preacher, and the author of many outstanding articles and books, Murray&#39;s driving passions were to declare Christ s Word, advance his cause, and bless his people.</p><h2>Leonardo da Vinci: The Marvelous Works of Nature and Man</h2><p>Drawing on a multiplicity of sources-including the Madrid manuscripts--Kemp traces the evolution of Leonardo&#39;s vision of man and nature and presents 188 line drawings and halftones that embody the richness of his vision</p><p></p><h2>Send This Message to My Church: Christ&#39;s Words to the Seven Churches of Revelation</h2><p>1.

Professor Lourds.&#x201d;<br>Dr. Thomas Lourds heard his name being called above the cacophony of languages surrounding him. He wasn&#x2019;t expecting anyone to meet him here inside the crowded passenger terminal of Istanbul&#x2019;s busy international airport. He didn&#x2019;t recognize the voice either&#x2014;but he could tell it was a young woman&#x2019;s. Thanks to years of teaching college students at Harvard, not to mention a well-earned reputation as a ladies&#x2019; man, he was rarely wrong when he gauged a woman&#x2019;s age from her voice. Curious, he stepped out of the flow of pedestrian traffic rushing through the airport toward baggage and ground transportation on the lower level.<br>A pretty redhead waved at him from twenty feet back and fought to get through the crowd between them. A mother leading two small children glared at the young woman. Not every traveler was upset&#x2014;a young man in his midtwenties wearing a bright French football jersey studied the woman who&#x2019;d jostled him in open admiration.<br>There was a lot to like. Tall and lean, she moved with the fluid grace of an athlete or a dancer. Lourds admired the view, too. She was dressed in hip-hugger jeans and a crop top that exposed some impressive cleavage above and a tanned midriff below. A diamond gleamed in her navel, emphasizing toned abs. Her dark red hair curled and glided across her bare freckled shoulders. But try as he might, Lourds couldn&#x2019;t remember meeting her before.<br>&#x201c;You are Professor Thomas Lourds, right?&#x201d; The young woman came to an abrupt stop in front of Lourds. Her hazel eyes drank him in. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re not, I&#x2019;m gonna really be embarrassed.&#x201d;<br>Lourds smiled a little bashfully. It was a look he could pull off when the occasion called for it. He was nearly old enough to be her father, so he figured a little bashfulness on his part might quell the disparaging looks he was receiving from some of the passersby.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Thomas Lourds.&#x201d; He shifted his cracked leather backpack to his other shoulder and extended his hand. &#x201c;If we&#x2019;ve met, I have to apologize. Your name slips my mind.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, we haven&#x2019;t met.&#x201d; She shook hands. Her grip was surprisingly firm, with soft skin toughened at the base of her fingers and the heel of her hand. The young lady must work out a lot.<br>&#x201c;You relieve my mind. I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d forget meeting such a beautiful young woman. And if I had, someone should shoot me and put me out of my misery.&#x201d;<br>The redhead smiled at him.<br>Slow down, Lourds chided himself. You&#x2019;ll scare her away.<br>But the chance meeting perked up his day considerably. He&#x2019;d spent the last several hours on a British Airways plane from London. The first class seating had been perfect&#x2014;except for the septuagenarian he&#x2019;d been stuck with the whole way. She&#x2019;d regaled him with stories about her life and her digestive tract, and he&#x2019;d plied himself with wine in self-defense. He still felt some of the aftereffects from the zinfandel and fully intended to lose the card the woman had pressed into his hand at the end of the trip.<br>Or possibly burn it in effigy.<br>&#x201c;You must think I&#x2019;m crazy,&#x201d; the redhead continued, &#x201c;calling after you in an airport, but I really wanted to see you.&#x201d;<br>Lourds released her hand and smiled. &#x201c;How else were you going to get my attention?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;True. But I would have liked to be a little more subtle and not so fan girl when I met you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you an admirer of the study of linguistics?&#x201d; Lourds had written a few books and several articles in that field.<br>&#x201c;Not exactly.&#x201d; She reached into her carry-on bag and brought out a hardback book.<br>Lourds recognized the lurid red-and-gold foil cover. It featured a languid, barely dressed male lounging in the shadows of a veiled bed. The man looked like he&#x2019;d just stepped from a Calvin Klein ad. He also, Lourds had been told by women, looked like he would be everything a woman could dream of.<br>That cover had sold a lot of books, and Lourds had enjoyed cashing the royalty checks. The image had also been a boon to his love life. He&#x2019;d discovered a long time ago that women loved to talk about sex with him, thanks to that cover. Lourds chose to pursue the subject intimately whenever the appropriate chance presented itself.<br>And there had been a lot of chances over his career. Even before the publication of the book the redhead held.<br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Lourds grinned. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a reader.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am.&#x201d; She proffered the book. &#x201c;I saw you, and I had to try to get your autograph. I figured it was serendipity. So here I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be happy to sign your book for you.&#x201d; Lourds took the copy and rummaged in his pocket for a pen.<br>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; She handed him a ballpoint.<br>&#x201c;I gather you enjoyed it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I did,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;But I prefer the CD. I&#x2019;m on my second copy of the audio book. I wore the first one out. I love your voice. I turn out the lights and listen to it in my bedroom a lot.&#x201d; She paused, winced, and bit her lip. &#x201c;Well, that wasn&#x2019;t awkward and embarrassing, was it?&#x201d;<br>Lourds waved the comment away. &#x201c;The audio book publisher insisted that I read the book after she heard me deliver a presentation on the translation.&#x201d;<br>The publisher had been young and lovely, and had taken a very personal interest in seeing to it that Lourds was treated like royalty.<br>&#x201c;The book says everything written in there is true. Is it?&#x201d;<br>Lourds couldn&#x2019;t count the number of times he&#x2019;d been asked that question. The fourth-century scroll containing the narrative published as Bedroom Pursuits had made Professor Thomas Lourds a house hold name. It had also made him something of a white elephant and favorite bastard son at Harvard. The dean of the distinguished university still winced every time he thought of the subject matter of Lourds&#x2019;s bestseller. The original document Lourds had decoded detailed the numerous and various acts of sexual congress of its author in lurid detail. Lourds&#x2019;s translation hadn&#x2019;t skimped on those details.<br>Personally, Lourds didn&#x2019;t know anything about the author other than what his translation of the scroll had revealed. Given the sexual escapades the man had described himself as having, as well as the natural equipment he&#x2019;d written about, Lourds figured if the man had been real, he must have been a physical marvel with the stamina of a god.<br>&#x201c;Do you think it&#x2019;s true?&#x201d; Lourds countered.<br>&#x201c;God, I hope so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t know how true the tales are. I just translated them from the original language&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And performed the audio presentation.&#x201d;<br>Lourds nodded. &#x201c;I did. But the sound studio upgraded the quality of my voice and added background music.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Kenny G, right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, someone that sounds an awfully lot like him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think you have a magnificent voice even without the background music.&#x201d; The redhead gave him a sultry smile.<br>&#x201c;Well ... thank you,&#x201d; Lourds said.<br>&#x201c;I am such a geek.&#x201d; The young woman looked mortified. &#x201c;I bet you get this all the time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Actually, no. Usually only at book signings. Most people don&#x2019;t recognize me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your picture is right on the back of the book. How can they not know who you are?&#x201d; She took the volume from Lourds and flipped it over to reveal the color photograph of him on the back.<br>It was a good picture and Lourds knew it. In it, he stood in front of a dig site in C�diz, Spain, where Atlantis had been lost, and found, and then lost again. He&#x2019;d written a book on that discovery and it had become a bestseller as well. But Bedroom Pursuits stayed at the top of the lists.<br>In the picture, Lourds wore khaki pants, hiking boots, an olive drab khaki shirt left open to show the white T-shirt beneath, and his beloved Australian Outback hat. He had that hat on right now. In the picture, his sunglasses hung nonchalantly from his T-shirt collar. He leaned casually on a shovel, and the mouth of a cave yawned in the stone wall behind him. His black hair was longish, a couple weeks overdue for the barber, and hung down slightly in his face. He sported a short-cropped goatee. Except for the outfit, he hadn&#x2019;t changed much since the picture was taken. He knew he looked at least ten years younger than his true age. It had its uses. Especially when he was interested in younger women.<br>&#x201c;Believe it or not,&#x201d; Lourds said ruefully, &#x201c;most people don&#x2019;t even read the author&#x2019;s name on a book. And fewer still remember the author&#x2019;s face. Meetings like this are something that usually only happens to rock stars and actors.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, you are the first author I&#x2019;ve chased down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you did. But you have me at a disadvantage.&#x201d; Lourds held the pen poised over the title page in the book. &#x201c;Whom should I make this out to?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Kristine. Kristine Webber. With a K.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c; &#x2018;For Kristine,&#x2019; &#x201d; Lourds said as he wrote, &#x201c; &#x2018;an autograph in exchange for that enchanting smile. I do hope you don&#x2019;t feel cheated.&#x2019; &#x201d; He blew on the page to dry the ink, then handed the book and the pen back.<br>&#x201c;No way. This is going to be the highlight of my trip to Istanbul.&#x201d; Kristine hugged the book for a moment before putting it back in the bag.<br>&#x201c;I sincerely hope that&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; Lourds said.<br>&#x201c;Sad to say, it is.&#x201d;<br>Lourds shook his head in disbelief. &#x201c;Istanbul is a fabulous place. Did you know it&#x2019;s the only city in the world that spans two continents?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an amazing place. I can&#x2019;t imagine being bored here.&#x201d; Lourds glanced at his watch. &#x201c;Do you have luggage?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, my God, I forgot.&#x201d; Panic widened Kristine&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Where should I go?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Since I&#x2019;ve been here a few times, maybe I can help you find the baggage carousel. Which airline did you come in on?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;British Airways. Same as you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good. We can chat on the way.&#x201d; Lourds nodded to the posted sign -age indicating the direction of the baggage carousel in three languages. He could read them all fluently. He took the lead and they set off.<br>&#x201c;What brings you to Istanbul?&#x201d; Lourds rode the escalator down to the terminal&#x2019;s lower floor. Kristine Webber stood at his side. Her perfume was intoxicating. It, or perhaps the wine he&#x2019;d consumed on the plane, made his head spin.<br>&#x201c;My father&#x2019;s got meetings here,&#x201d; Kristine replied. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s an international investor.&#x201d; She shrugged. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s here working some kind of corporate merger and wanted me to spend time with him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That sounds nice.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Usually he spends more time on the phone working at his business than with me. I end up ordering a lot of room service and catching up on movies.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry to hear it.&#x201d;<br>At the bottom of the escalator, Lourds got his bearings and walked toward the British Airways carousel. A crowd waited patiently but the warning lights weren&#x2019;t flashing. None of the luggage had yet arrived.<br>&#x201c;You should take time to see the city,&#x201d; Lourds said.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like the idea of wandering around alone.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know anyone here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nope. Like I told you, meeting you is going to be the highlight of this trip. I&#x2019;m going to be stranded at the hotel looking out through the window at a city I&#x2019;ve never been to.&#x201d;<br>Lourds hesitated just a moment, then took the plunge. He and Dr. Olympia Adnan, the woman he&#x2019;d come here to meet, had once been close, but that was a handful of years ago. The last he&#x2019;d heard, when she called him back in January, Olympia had mentioned being involved with a Belgian archeologist. So Olympia wouldn&#x2019;t be available to fill all the long evenings he&#x2019;d be spending here. Perhaps he&#x2019;d just found a nice diversion.<br>&#x201c;I could show you the city,&#x201d; Lourds said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re interested. It&#x2019;s the fourth-largest city in the world, and people have been living here continuously since 6500 B.C.E.&#x2014;that&#x2019;s nearly nine thousand years. Its first known name, Byzantium, still rings throughout human language. It&#x2019;s a UNESCO World Heritage site. You really shouldn&#x2019;t miss it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you offer to guide often, Professor Lourds?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Often was such a subjective word.<br>&#x201c;Will I be in good hands?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Most definitely.&#x201d; Lourds smiled and felt his anticipation rise. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot to see in this city, and it would be my plea sure to escort you when you have time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good. Now, if you&#x2019;ll just point out your bags, I&#x2019;d be happy to fetch them for you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one. I had the rest of my things sent to the hotel. I refuse to be stripped naked if my luggage gets lost.&#x201d;<br>That delightful image ricocheted through Lourds&#x2019;s mind and he had to force himself to look for his bags.<br>&#x201c;Are you here on vacation?&#x201d; Kristine asked.<br>Lourds paced beside the young man wheeling his bags toward the cab and limousine stands. The professor carried his backpack because he never willingly let it leave his side. His work and his computer were in that backpack.<br>One of his suitcases was crammed with books, and the porter had struggled with it. When it came to research interfaces, Lourds still preferred printed matter he could depend on when electrical outlets weren&#x2019;t plentiful.<br>&#x201c;More of a working vacation,&#x201d; Lourds said.<br>Kristine sighed. &#x201c;So much for promises of taking me sightseeing through a beautiful city.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t confuse me with your workaholic father,&#x201d; Lourds objected. &#x201c;I take my playtime just as seriously as I do my work time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to hear it. What are you going to be working on while you&#x2019;re here?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A&#x2014;&#x201d; Lourds hesitated over how to address his relationship with Olympia Adnan. &#x201c;&#x2014;colleague of mine has invited me to speak to her graduate classes at Istanbul University.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;About Bedroom Pursuits?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. About more serious matters. There are some items the Rare Masterpieces and Museum Department of the Central Library have that she&#x2019;d like me to lecture on.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Will there be a test?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;God, I hope not.&#x201d; Lourds grinned. &#x201c;If there is, the students will hate me. Hopefully I&#x2019;ll be able to lead informal discussions that will inspire them.&#x201d; He held up a thumb and forefinger. &#x201c;A little.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to want to talk to you about your book.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Books,&#x201d; Lourds corrected. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably right.&#x201d; Nearly everywhere he went, the topic of Bedroom Pursuits invariably came up.<br>&#x201c;Are these items you&#x2019;re looking at a big deal?&#x201d; Kristine asked.<br>&#x201c;I hope so. Most of them have never been studied by American scholars,&#x201d; Lourds replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be the first. I&#x2019;m really excited about it.&#x201d;<br>He stopped at the curb and glanced out over the sea of vehicles threading through the terminal streets. His nose and eyes burned from the noxious exhaust.<br>&#x201c;Are you going to be in another television special about the artifacts? I saw the ones you did in Egypt and in Spain. The whole Race to Atlantis thing.&#x201d;<br>Memories flooded Lourds&#x2019;s mind. Though he&#x2019;d seen many things and been part of some wondrous discoveries in his professional career, nothing he&#x2019;d been through before or since could match the pursuit of Lost Atlantis. It had fascinated, terrified, and very nearly killed him. Now ... well, now he found he missed being on the hunt.<br>For the last few months, though he wouldn&#x2019;t have admitted it to anyone, he&#x2019;d longed for something equally interesting to invade his life again. Living on the knife&#x2019;s edge like that had been an incredible adrenaline rush.<br>Kristine pointed at the taxi stand. &#x201c;We can get a cab there. Where are you staying?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Eresin Crown Hotel.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Really? So am I.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Lourds said, &#x201c;isn&#x2019;t that convenient?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It is. Maybe we can have breakfast before you go off to your speaking engagement in the morning.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That would be great.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In the meantime, want to share a cab to the hotel and get a drink at the bar?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;That sounds fantastic,&#x201d; Lourds agreed. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m supposed to have a car waiting for me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s coming to pick you up?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes.

He lives in Archer City, Texas.Molina reads in soft-spoken, comfortable tones that make the listener's experience relaxing, as well as entertaining. McMurtry continues his saga of Lord Berrybender and his four willful daughters, his haughty mistress, and their inept servants. As these characters meet up with real historical figures like Kit Carson, Charles Bent, and Pomp Charbonneau, the ironies, vanities, and tragedies of the West are revealed. Alfred Molina finds unique male and female voices for McMurtry's finely drawn cast. He precisely captures Tasmin Berrybender Snow's frosty temperament and her primitive frontiersman, Jim's, frustration and bewilderment. Molina's accents for everyone from Sioux war chief to English journalist and French aristocrat are perfect and engaging. S.C.A.

Schurke recounts the experiences of the Bering Bridge expedition during March-May, 1989. Through his persistence as co-leader, 12 Soviet and American adventurers, including three Eskimos and three Chukchis, visited a string of remote Siberian villages, crossed the International Date Line, and continued the journey to native towns in Alaska. The group encountered red tape (the Bering Strait had been closed to travel in either direction since 1948), fierce weather, and team rivalries, but Schurke never gave up his dream uniting the people of two continents. The expedition received warm welcomes on both sides of the Strait, united native team members with distant relatives, and helped East-West relations. In April 1989, the governors of Siberia and Alaska signed a protocol requesting their governments to open the border to travel by native peoples. In September 1989 this became a reality. A story of high adventure by dogsled, skis, and skin boat. --Mary Gerrity, Queen Anne School, Upper Marlboro, MD<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.The 12-member Soviet-American Bering Bridge Expedition traveled 1000 miles from Anadyr, Siberia to Kotzebue, Alaska by dogsleds, skis, and other modes of transportation with the expressed aim of opening up the Soviet/American border for free passage of native Siberians and Americans. Although the "dogsled diplomats" suffered the usual Arctic miseries, they were rewarded by the achievement of their goal. Bering Bridge is a readable account by co-leader Schurke which will appeal to a wide audience.

For the important thing about THE IMPORTANT BOOK is that the book goes on long after it is closed.</p><p><blockquote><i> "The important thing about rain is/ that it is wet./ It falls out of the sky,/ and it sounds like rain,/ and makes things shiny,/ and it does not taste like anything,/ and is the color of air./ But the important thing about rain is that it is wet."</i> </blockquote><p> <i>Goodnight Moon</i> creator Margaret Wise Brown's <i>The Important Book</i> is a deceptively simple exercise--taking familiar things like an apple, spoon, or shoe, and finding the most basic association with those things. The most important thing about an apple? It is round. A spoon? You eat with it. A shoe? You put your foot in it. But why, according to Brown, is the most important thing about grass "that it is green," while the most important thing about an apple is "that it is round"? Why is "that it is white" the most important thing about snow <i>and</i> a daisy? Whether or not you'd distill these things in the same way that the author does, Brown makes us think about the essence of everyday entities in new ways. The illustrations, by Caldecott Medal winner Leonard Weisgard (<i>The Little Island</i>), perform the same function--capturing the spoonness of spoons, the roundness of an apple, the motion of wind.</p><p> Happily, Brown went on to create the companion <i>Another Important Book</i>, about the importance of being one, two, three, four, five, and six years old--published for the first time in 1999 with fabulous artwork by Caldecott Honor artist Chris Raschka (<i>Yo! Yes?</i>). Both of Brown's "important books" will endure the test of time as fresh, thought-provoking ways to examine the world around us. (Click to see a sample spread.

In this vivid and beautifully written biography, Helen Langdon tells the story of the great painter&#39;s life and times in a way that leaves the reader with a renewed appreciation of his art.</p><p>Seventeenth-century painter Nicolas Poussin once said that Caravaggio came into the world to destroy painting. Helen Langdon's marvelous biography suggests that rather than destroying painting, the Milanese artist gave it a new lease on life. Upon his arrival in Rome, Caravaggio ended a tradition of Italian Renaissance painting with his radically new naturalistic style, which continues to dazzle and influence viewers today. Beautifully poised between biographical scholarship and artistic appreciation, Langdon's book provides the reader with a complex, fascinating portrait of Caravaggio, still the rebel and outsider of the popular imagination, but also immersed in the Roman world of art, politics, and patronage. Some of the finest sections of the book vividly evoke the streets and brothels of early 17th-century Rome, which provided Caravaggio with the inspiration for many of his early works. By contrast, the later sections--which deal with Caravaggio's exile and commissions in Naples, Malta, and Sicily--seem rather brief and truncated, giving the final third of the book a rather unbalanced feel. This is, however, partly due to the elusiveness of Caravaggio himself--with little direct contemporary documentation on the painter, he often slips into the shadows, evading the scrutiny of even the most persistent biographer. <p> Langdon's achievement here is to produce a compelling portrait of the artist that throws new light on his paintings. Here is a painter who was proud, difficult, and arrogant, yet highly intellectual in his appreciation of the changing face of both Catholicism and scientific enquiry. Written with great historical clarity, and supplemented by 42 magnificent color illustrations, Helen Langdon's <i>Caravaggio</i> is a worthy contribution to scholarly study of this artist. <i>--Jerry Brotton</i></p><b>Helen Langdon</b> has worked at the National Gallery, the British Museum, and the National Portrait Gallery.

Mann&#39;s Westerns, noir pictures, and epics are admired and studied by fans and scholars alike, and he was an expert in the fundamental elements of cinema (movement and placement of the camera, composition in the frame, and careful editing). Jeanine Basinger&#39;s Anthony Mann, which places the director&#39;s visual style at the center of its analysis, was among the first formal studies of any filmmaker, and it set a standard in the field over twenty-five years ago. Long out of print and much in demand, this pioneering book is now available again, featuring complete coverage of those Mann films not discussed in the original work, as well as over fifty rare film stills. Wesleyan is proud to issue this expanded edition of an essential text, making it available to new generations of filmgoers and readers.</p><p>JEANINE BASINGER is Corwin-Fuller Professor of Film Studies at Wesleyan University, founder and curator of the Wesleyan Cinema Archives, and the author of nine books on film, including Silent Stars (1999) and The Star Machine (2007). She is a trustee of the National Board of Review and a trustee emeritus of the American Film Institute."Thank the film gods that the only serious book in English about Mann is a brilliant one. I am grateful to Basinger's clear-eyed analysis for helping me go ever deeper into the work of one of my absolute favorite directors."&#x2015;Alexander Payne, co-writer/director, Sideways</p><h2>A Tapestry of Hope (Lights of Lowell Series #1)</h2><p>Lights of Lowell book 1. <i>Tapestry of Hope</i> weaves together the heartrending and hope-building stories of two young women.

Ruby Sawyer, born in 1912, has lived her whole life in a Vermont lumber camp, where she idolizes her Pa, a logger. Then he is killed in an accident, and Ruby, her Ma, and her 10 siblings must move to a small house near town. In the midst of her loneliness and sorrow, the 10-year-old meets Mrs. Graham, a kindly blind woman who lets Ruby read her books. When the child begins teaching some of the loggers to read, she is on the path to discovering her life's work. While the "lumber camp library" of the book's title is not established until nearly the last page, the narrative builds effectively to that point. This story is gentle enough for beginning readers without glossing over the more difficult details of Ruby's life. The novel is long enough to get readers involved, but moves along quickly enough to hold their interest, and they will be transfixed by the strong and spirited Ruby.<br><i>Kristen Oravec, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Strongsville, OH</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>NIV Adventure Bible: New International Version</h2><p>The Adventure Bible keeps getting better.

And it is his towering presence that makes it so difficult to imagine the artist as a man. Art historian James Beck helps unlock the mystery of Michelangelo by opening the doors of the three very different worlds to which he belonged. Michelangelo&#39;s father, his famous and influential patron Lorenzo de Medici, and Pope Julius II who, according to Beck, forced the Sistine Chapel commission onto its now-famous painter, divided the rule of these worlds between them and held powerful sway over the artist. Michelangelo left behind a fair amount of correspondence, upon which Beck heavily relies. But beyond that, there is a dearth of reliable information about the subject. Michelangelo himself carefully oversaw the contemporary biographies--selling 16th-century writers on the notion that he was divinely preordained to become a renowned artist. Beck is clearly a careful researcher and he skillfully combines the facts at hand and collateral information about the era to recreate the artist&#39;s world. He freely draws on this information to form opinions about his subject&#39;s sexuality, passion for his art, and relationships to the powerful men in his life. He evokes, too, a strong visual sense of Michelangelo&#39;s environment--the Medici palace where he lived for a time, the Vatican of the Renaissance, the artist&#39;s own work. This is definitely a compelling story, but bear in mind that because of the distinct lack of reliable source material, this biography falls somewhere between fact and well-informed historical fiction.This anemic treatment of Michelangelo Buonarroti's early career aspires to "reach the quality that lies behind both his life and his work?his humanity," in order to counterbalance the epithet "divine" that has been his since the Renaissance. Beck (coauthor of Art Restoration: The Culture, the Business and the Scandal), a Columbia University art historian, identifies three strong father figures who, Beck writes, served as distinctive "epicenters" for Michelangelo's surging creativity: Lorenzo de' Medici, the de facto leader of Florence who encouraged the artist during his adolescence; Lodovico Buonarroti, his biological father, whose querulous influence increased markedly with Lorenzo's death in 1492; and Pope Julius II, his greatest patron. However, Beck fails to exploit this promising analytical framework, instead proceeding in a ploddingly chronological fashion. Rather than bringing the artist's multiple "worlds" into useful focus, or demonstrating how the three men informed his work (beyond the tender family scenes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel), Beck sets out to debunk stock theories about Michelangelo: his terribilita (terrible disposition), his homosexuality, his aesthetic leaning toward the non finito (unfinished) and the conceptual grouping of the central Sistine narratives (opposing the conventional three groups of three, Beck contends for a four-one-four arrangement, a point hardly relevant to the lay reader). Granted, Beck offers some wonderful anecdotes, and his account of a meeting held on January 25, 1504 to discuss the placement of Michelangelo's 13-foot David is nothing short of thrilling, as Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Perugino, Filipino Lippi, Piero di Cosimo and everyone else of consequence in the Florentine art world all weighed in on the subject of their fellow artist's greatest triumph. Ultimately, this is a frustrating book with some very engaging passages.

According to William Greider, this revolution is a juggernaut that neither multinational corporations nor governments can control. Greider looks at the impact of the global revolution in terms of human struggle. While huge amounts of wealth are being generated, there is a downside, too: social dislocation; economic uncertainty; and the oldest, rawest form of exploitation--that of the weak by the strong. Greider proposes a number of steps governments of the world can take to avert disaster: moderate the flow of goods by imposing tariffs to rectify trade deficits, change labor practices in developing countries, and allow labor to share in the ownership of capital.William Greider is the National Editor of Rolling Stone magazine.</p><h2>80 Most Requested LDS Songs from the Inspirational Music Showcase</h2><p>Spiral bound. 80 MOST requested LDS Songs.</p><p></p><h2>Many a River</h2><p><p>The Barfield family, Arkansas sharecroppers, are heading west with their sons Jeffrey and Todd.

The family had left Arkansas by wagon two months ago and slowly picked their way across the eastern part of Texas, looking for land Papa would consider to be just right. Mama had seen a dozen sites she would be happy with, but Papa invariably said, "There's bound to be better a little farther west." <p></p><p></p>Eight-going-on-nine, Jeffrey was beginning to fear the family would still be wandering when he celebrated his next birthday. They had passed through Fort Worth, then moved on westward, stopping hopefully here a day, there a day, and going on. Now they had camped on a pleasant, clear-running creek miles beyond Weatherford. Papa walked in a slow circle, kicking up soil with his boot, then reaching down with calloused farmer hands to scoop up a bit of it. He sniffed at it and let it slowly spill out between his fingers. <p></p><p></p>Watching from afar, Jeffrey said, "Reckon this is it, Mama? Reckon he'll decide this is the place?" <p></p><p></p>Mama touched his shoulder gently. She looked tired. "I don't know, son. I've wished so many times . . ." She turned toward her campfire. "You'd better fetch me a little more dry wood." <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey heard a boyish shout and glanced about for his younger brother. Todd was romping with a brown dog that had accompanied the family as the wagon bumped its way through Arkansas. With a fleeting impatience, Jeffrey shouted, "Hush up, Todd. You'll run off any game that's within hearin' of you." <p></p><p></p>Todd quieted down for a minute or two but quickly forgot Jeffrey's admonition. He began playing fetch-the-stick with the dog. Jeffrey shrugged. Remaining quiet seemed too much to ask of an energetic five-year-old boy. <p></p><p></p>He gathered a few small branches from dead brush and broke them across his knee, carrying them back to the .re. Papa had strayed three hundred yards from the wagon. Mama raised her hand to her slat bonnet to shade her eyes from the noonday sun. She said, "Better go fetch him, son. Dinner'll be ready when you-all get back." <p></p><p></p>"Yes, ma'am. Papa loses all track of time." <p></p><p></p>He met Todd walking in from his game. Not seeing the dog, he asked, "Where's Brownie?" <p></p><p></p>"He got tired of chasin' a stick. He took off after a rabbit." <p></p><p></p>"You better get back to the wagon and wash your face and hands. It'll soon be time to eat." <p></p><p></p>Todd quickened his pace. He liked to play, but eating pleased him even more. <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey gave Papa the message. Papa sounded disappointed. "All right, I'm done here. Soon as we've finished eatin' dinner, we'll break camp and move on." <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey tried not to frown. Mama always said Papa knew best, even when she didn't believe it herself. "This isn't the place?" <p></p><p></p>"Maybe a little farther on." <p></p><p></p>They had not seen a soul since they left Weatherford. Jeffrey asked, "Ain't we gotten out pretty far past everybody else?" <p></p><p></p>"That's the way I like it. We get first pick." <p></p><p></p>At the wagon, Papa broke the news that they were moving on. Mama took it without comment, but Todd protested, "Brownie ain't come back. We can't just leave him." <p></p><p></p>Papa said, "If he don't find his way to us, we'll have to go without him." <p></p><p></p>Todd puckered up. Papa said sternly, "You're too big to start cryin'." <p></p><p></p>Todd said, "I don't ever cry." <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey saw the hurt in his brother's eyes. He said, "I'll go hunt for him. He may not have sense enough to follow us." <p></p><p></p>Papa warned, "Don't waste much time. We'll be startin' pretty soon." <p></p><p></p>The noonday sun bore heavily on Jeffrey's thin shoulders and sent sweat trickling down his freckled face. He never cussed in front of Papa or Mama, but he was a mile or more from them now. He stated his opinion of the wayward dog in terms he had heard his father use in addressing a team of mules. Papa often relied on profanity for its ability to relieve stress. <p></p><p></p>"You can stay out here and starve to death for all I care," Jeffrey shouted at the absent animal. <p></p><p></p>Well, no big loss. Brownie rarely played with him, preferring to rip around with Todd. Jeffrey turned and started back, his feet dragging, his steps shorter than when he had begun. He had not gone far before he heard the dog barking off to his left. He saw a moving cloud of dust and heard the drumming of hooves. Someone was pushing a band of horses in a slow lope. As wind shifted the dust, he counted a dozen or more riders. <p></p><p></p>He froze in midstride. They were Indians, and they were riding headlong toward the wagon camp. <p></p><p></p>The shock gave Jeffrey fresh strength. He broke into a run, shouting a warning. His was a boy's voice, high-pitched find too weak to carry far. Remembering terrible tales he had heard about Indian raids, he began crying. He heard a shot and recognized the sound of the rifle. Papa was serving notice that he intended to defend himself and his family. <p></p><p></p>Several Indians left the horse herd and circled the wagon. Papa's rifle fired once more, then a shotgun blasted. That would be Mama, pitching in. Jeffrey was close enough now to see Papa go down and to hear Mama scream before a warrior crushed her head with a club. <p></p><p></p>He realized that the Indians could see him if they looked in his direction. He dropped to his stomach and hid himself in the tall grass. Instinct cried out for him to rush to the wagon and try to help, but fear paralyzed him. An inner voice told him it was already too late, that he would only get himself killed. <p></p><p></p>He heard Todd cry out as an Indian lifted him onto his horse. The boy futilely beat the warrior with his fists. The man swung the hard handle of a rawhide quirt and struck Todd a sharp blow to the side of his head. Todd went limp. Jeffrey then lost sight of his brother and the Indian in the stirring of dust as warriors circled the wagon. He heard them shouting in celebration while they looted it of blankets and foodstuffs. They gathered up the mule team Papa had staked on grass near camp and tried to set fire to the wagon. They succeeded only in burning much of the canvas cover before wind snuffed out the blaze. They rode away, adding the mules to their band of loose horses. <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey lay on the ground for several minutes, trembling, fearing that some Indians might lag behind and see him. Finally, choking with fear, he forced himself to his feet and trudged to the wagon. He knew what he would surely find, but he denied it to himself. Mama and Papa must somehow have survived. They had to. <p></p><p></p>But they had not. Mama lay twisted on the ground, eyes open but not seeing. Her head was bloody, her scalp torn away. Wind tugged at her long skirt. Papa lay across a hot cast-iron dutch oven that sat atop live coals. His clothing smoldered, and Jeffrey smelled burning flesh. Papa too had been scalped. <p></p><p></p>Todd was not there. <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey dragged his father away from the heat and used his bare hands to beat out the slow flames that had burned holes in shirt and trousers. He dropped to his knees and let the tears flow. Body quaking, he shouted out in grief and fear and rage. <p></p><p></p>He lost all sense of time, crying until he was exhausted. Eventually he forced himself to his feet and began to look around, to take stock of the situation into which he had so suddenly been thrust. Mama and Papa were dead. Todd was gone, probably dead too, or he would be when the Indians grew tired of him. Of what use could a five-year-old boy be to them? <p></p><p></p>Flies had already found his parents' wounds. Mama had been wearing an apron. Jeffrey spread it to cover her head. He found Papa's fallen hat and laid it across his father's still face. <p></p><p></p>He knew there was no need to look for the rifle or the shotgun. The Indians would have taken those as prizes of the raid. He thought of the dog. It had barked at the horses, probably alerting the Indians to the wagon camp even before they saw it. Jeffrey ventured out, calling again for Brownie. <p></p><p></p>He found the dog a hundred yards away, dead, with two large wounds in its side. A third wound still had part of an arrow shaft in it. Evidently the Indians had tried to retrieve their arrows but had broken one off. <p></p><p></p>"Damn you, Brownie," Jeffrey said, "you had it comin' to you." <p></p><p></p>He realized then that his own life had been spared because the dog had wandered off. Otherwise he would have been in camp when the Indians struck. He moderated his tone. "I hope you caught your rabbit." <p></p><p></p>The family milk cow had been staked near the wagon. She lay dead, a hind leg cut off and carried away. It had been one of Jeffrey's chores to milk her twice a day. She was mean about kicking, so he did not mourn her. <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey could not bear to see Mama and Papa lying there on the ground. They needed to be buried. He found the shovel where it was supposed to be, strapped to the side of the wagon. The Indians had seen no need for it. He was practiced in use of the shovel. He had dug fire pits and unearthed old stumps to serve as firewood for his mother as they had moved west from Arkansas. He chose a piece of ground above the creek's high-water mark and began to dig a hole wide enough that he could bury Papa and Mama side by side, the way they had been as far back as he could remember. <p></p><p></p>The grave was waist deep when he heard horses. Fear fell over him again like a smothering blanket. He dropped to his stomach in the hole, certain more Indians were coming. He heard the horses stop at the camp. As men raised their voices in excitement, he recognized familiar words. These riders were not Indians. Climbing out of the hole, he waved his hat over his head, afraid the men might ride on without seeing him. He began running, stumbling toward the wagon, trying to shout but not finding his voice. <p></p><p></p>A couple of men raised rifles, startled by the boy's unexpected appearance. They lowered them quickly. One rider moved out to meet him, dismounting and kneeling, anxiously studying Jeffrey at his own eye level. The man was two hundred pounds of muscle and bone. His bearing indicated that he was the kind who would automatically take charge without waiting for someone else. Touching a huge hand to Jeffrey's shoulder, he demanded, "Anybody here besides you?" <p></p><p></p>"No, sir," Jeffrey managed, his voice breaking. "The Indians didn't see me." Guilt burned deeply as he admitted, "I hid." <p></p><p></p>"A good thing you did. I suppose that's your mother and father we found back yonder?" <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey sobbed once, then forced a measure of control. "Yes, sir. And they carried off my little brother." He felt a moment of hope. "Maybe you can catch them and make them give Todd back." <p></p><p></p>The big man's heavy eyebrows came together in a dark frown. "We're tryin' to catch them, but I doubt it'll do your brother any good. The minute we close with them, they generally kill any prisoners. Best we can hope for is to make them bleed for what they've done. And maybe we can get back the horses they stole on this raid." <p></p><p></p>Hope collapsed as quickly as it had risen. "You can't save Todd?" <p></p><p></p>"I'm sorry to put it to you so strong, but if they haven't already killed him, they will." <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey lost control and wept again. In a kindly voice the bearded man said, "You've got to face it like a man. He's gone, like your mama and daddy are gone." <p></p><p></p>The other men gathered around, some voicing sympathy, others demanding angrily that they keep riding. They had raiders to catch and kill. The bearded man said, "Adam, how about you and Matthew Temple stayin' here with this boy? The rest of us will see if we can get us some Indians." <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey said, "I want to go with you. I want to find my brother." <p></p><p></p>"You'd best put aside any notion of seein' your brother again. It'd just lead to fresh disappointment. You've got hurt enough already." <p></p><p></p>The grim-faced group of fifteen or so volunteers set off in a long trot, following the plain trail beaten out by the warriors and their stolen horses and mules. Jeffrey turned to the two men left behind. Matthew Temple had a ragged beard that once had been black but now was spotted with gray. He looked like most of the farmers Jeffrey had known back home, men used to hard work. His hips were broad but his stomach flat. He said, "Fletcher's probably right to leave us, Adam. My horse is about worn out, and yours looks little better." <p></p><p></p>Adam was younger, his beard short and brown, covering much of a face dark and weathered. He said, "I'd just like to be there for the fight. I lost two horses to them damned Comanches." <p></p><p></p>"We don't know for sure they're Comanches." <p></p><p></p>"I don't see that it makes any difference. They're Indians, and they'll all kill you if they get the chance. Like they done this boy's folks, and some others back yonder." <p></p><p></p>Matthew took a wrinkled handkerchief from a hip pocket and wiped the tears from Jeffrey's dusty face. "Son, we can't just leave your mama and daddy layin' there. We'd best be gettin' them under." <p></p><p></p>Jeffrey pointed to the higher ground. "I'd done started diggin' before you-all came." <p></p><p></p>"How were you goin' to get them all the way up there?" <p></p><p></p>"I'm pretty strong." <p></p><p></p>Matthew's expression showed he was dubious. "How old are you?" <p></p><p></p>"Eight, and some past." <p></p><p></p>"About the age my boy Henry was." With a sad look in his eyes, Matthew shook his head. "You're too young to shoulder a man's load. You ought to be playin' schoolboy games and learnin' to read and cipher. But sometimes the Lord in his wisdom throws a thunderbolt at us. Are you a God-fearin' lad?" <p></p><p></p>"My folks are churchgoin' people. My grandpa used to preach." <p></p><p></p>"Looks like we'll have to send you back to him.

They passed through the tribal areas and the princely states of the North-West Frontier Province, and into Baluchistan. This appears to be the first time that any American officials were permitted to travel for any distance along either side of the Durand Line. Many British political and military officers believed that India would soon be free, and that the Great Game between Russia and Britain in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries would then come to an end. Some of them thought that the United States should, and would, assume Britain's role in Central Asia, and they wanted to introduce America to this ancient contest.</p><p>George J.

Their mission, closely followed in the American and international press, had two (secret) goals: to fix the game in the American consciousness as the purest expression of the national spirit, and to seed markets for Spalding's products near and far. In the process, these first cultural ambassadors played before kings and queens, visited the Coliseumand the Eiffel Tower, and took pot shots with their baseballs at the great Sphinx in Egypt. This expedition to lands both exotic and familiar is chronicled with dash and wit in Mark Lamster's <i>Spalding's World Tour</i>, a book filled with larger-than-life characters often competing harder for love and money off the baseball diamond than for runs on it. Getting themselves into scrapes and narrowly escaping international incident all around the globe, these innocents abroad gave the world an early peek at the American century just around the corner. For anyone interested in the history of the game&#x2014;or the history of brand marketing&#x2014;<i>Spalding's World Tour</i> hits the sweet spot.</p><p>Mark Lamster is senior acquisitions editor at Princeton Architectural Press in New York. His writing on baseball, history, design, and architecture has appeared in numerous publications, including the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, <i>Metropolis</i>, <i>I.D.</i>, and <i>Architecture</i>. Lamster lives in New York City and is an active member of the Society of American Baseball Research.During the winter that followed the 1888 season, Chicago White Stockings owner and sporting goods magnate Albert Goodwill Spalding led a tour of professional baseball players around the world. His White Stockings battled the All-Americans, a team of standouts recruited from rival clubs, as they barnstormed from Chicago to San Francisco, then sailed for New Zealand and Australia, and went on to introduce the game to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Egypt, Italy, France, Britain and Ireland. <p>Judging by the recently completed 2006 World Baseball Classic, the expedition failed to achieve any lasting impact. Only two of the nations Spalding visited fielded teams, winning between them just a single game. At the time, however, the tour was big news. The teams were bid farewell by President Grover Cleveland and welcomed back by his successor, Benjamin Harrison. While they traveled, the New York Sun featured almost daily dispatches from correspondent Newton MacMillan on its front page. Upon their return, Mark Twain delivered a rollicking speech at a celebratory banquet in the famed New York eatery Delmonico's.</p><p>In Spalding's World Tour, Mark Lamster, a devoted baseball historian and an editor at Princeton Architectural Press, attempts a door-to-door account of the expedition. There's comparatively little play-by-play here, although most of the tour's 57 games warrant at least a brief accounting; for the true baseball buff, there is an appendix featuring, if not the full box scores, at least the results. Instead, Lamster draws on a host of journalistic accounts, published memoirs and diaries to convey the players' impressions of foreign lands, the shipboard banter, their misadventures at ports of call, as well as the logistical roadblocks to planning and promoting a round-the-world tour in the days before the Pacific cable.</p><p>Lamster is especially strong on the career of Spalding. Raised without a father from the age of 8 in the rural outskirts of Chicago, Spalding broke onto the baseball scene as a 17-year-old phenom who pitched his scrubby Rockford, Ill., club to a deeply improbable victory over a nationally known team of barnstormers based in Washington, D.C. Spalding is a towering figure in the development of baseball. He was the game's first true impresario and the architect of its founding myth, that baseball was invented by Abner Doubleday in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1839.</p><p>The rest of Spalding's crew was hardly less memorable. At shortstop for the All-Americans was the great John Montgomery Ward, a Columbia-trained lawyer who, owing to an ongoing labor dispute over baseball's notorious reserve clause binding players to teams indefinitely, was plotting his upstart Players League even as he traveled the globe on Spalding's dime. The Chicago captain was Adrian Anson, the league's premiere player -- variously nicknamed "Cap," "The Baby" and "The Chicago Fakir" -- and one of the early practitioners of the "hit and run" play, an egomaniac and an incorrigible arguer with umpires. Anson was also, in Lamster's words, "the most visible proponent of the movement to keep blacks out of organized baseball"; his refusal to play against a team fielding black star Moses Walker directly led to baseball's official ban on black players in 1887.</p><p>There was one black American traveling with the team: mascot Clarence Duval, a diminutive baton twirler, comedian and singer of "plantation songs" who went on to tour with Bert Williams's minstrel show. Duval was the victim of the ballplayers' cruelest prank: When a 15-foot shark was sighted off the ship's bow as the teams plied the Indian Ocean, Anson offered to catch the fish using Duval as bait. Faced with Duval's abject terror, the captain rejected this suggestion, opting instead to use a hunk of salt pork. </p><p>The discordance between present and past attitudes about race and culture clouds Lamster's attempt at an uncomplicated embrace of the baseball tourists. Duval, for instance, is never quoted in journalistic accounts of the tour except as speaking in dialect. Of his visit to Ceylon, New York Herald correspondent Harry Palmer remembers that "the dusky inhabitants were thicker even than the Chinese in Chinatown, San Francisco." Lamster's willingness to quote firsthand observers at length is admirable, especially since many of them are at least his equal with the pen, but his efforts to place these remarks in the context of prevailing 19th-century views of race and culture come off more as an exercise in manners than the work of a practiced historian. </p><p>Spalding's Tour is today remembered mostly for an oft-reproduced photograph of a group of ballplayers arrayed around the Sphinx, where they played an impromptu baseball game and afterward took turns trying fruitlessly to hurl balls over the Pyramids. Lamster's book reintroduces a fascinating and long-overlooked chapter in baseball history to fans and historians and offers a glimpse at an early chapter in baseball's long march to globalization.</p><p>Reviewed by Adam Mazmanian <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Nothing less than a manifesto for a new social and psychological revolution to save our threatened planet, this book is a summary of the penetrating thought of Eric Fromm. His thesis is that two modes of existence struggle for the spirit of humankind: the having mode, which concentrates on material possessions, power, and aggression, and is the basis of the universal evils of greed, envy, and violence; and the being mode, which is based on love, the pleasure of sharing, and in productive activity. To Have Or to Be? is a brilliant program for socioeconomic change.</p><p>Born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Erich Fromm (1900-1980) studied sociology and psychoanalysis. In 1933, he emigrated as a member of the Frankfurt School of social thinkers to the United States, moved to Mexico in 1950, and spent his twilight years between 1974 and 1980 in Switzerland. His books Fear of Freedom (1941) and The Art of Loving (1956) made him famous. Other well-known books are Marx&#39;s Concept of Man, Beyond the Chains of Illusion, and The Essential Fromm.</p><h2>Wool Gathering: A Sheep Family Reunion</h2><p>This collection of twenty-four poems offers an amusing tale about a sheep family reunion where relatives of all shapes and sizes come together for a boisterous celebration.</p><p><b>Lisa Wheeler</b> lives a no-frills life in southeastern Michigan with three children, two dogs, one husband, and NO sheep. "Fortunately," she says, "like the sheep family, I have some wonderfully odd relatives. I am sure they've inspired me to spin this yarn."This waggish collection of poems about an unorthodox family get-together brims with enough visual and verbal fun to appeal to both parents and children alike. The felicitous combination of whimsical watercolors and quick-witted text features a rambunctious, munching family with a plethora of spring "Lambie Kins" who get "passed from sheep to sheep/ and kissed and kissed and kissed!" Newcomer Wheeler is not sheepish about clever puns and wordplay; the character poems especially stand out. "Sister Alabaster," the Kung-Fu master, "sure knows her chops"; "Aunt Eweginia" always makes "ewesful" things even as she "knits till she is nude." The design deserves kudos, too: on one spread, the sheep play "Baa-dminton" and opt for nibbling grass over perfecting their swing while, opposite, "Brunch," shows a baseball diamond and describes "A nibble here/ A nibble there/ Where has the infield gone?" The layout also plays up the punch line for a couple of poems: goofy "Woolverton" carries a bouquet of flowers and wears a love-sick expression, but doesn't know his true love is a cow (revealed with the turn of a page), and "Hiram's Horns" are so magnificent, the family decorates them each Christmas (a full spread is dedicated to their finery). These irresistible sheep relatives will captivate young readers from the time they arrive to their last "So long... farewool... good-baaa."

Ohio, located in the heart of the nation, is also the heart of the nation&#x2019;s history and Bill points out hundreds of historic sites, museums, and monuments all on the backroads. Bill purposely devised tours that take the rider down these history-filled roads that started out as trails, such as the Sandusky Trail, the Bullskin Trace, Hull&#x2019;s Trace, and more. Each Chapter has a theme such as Following the Water, which includes routes titled The Great River Road, Lake Eire Tour, The Lake Eire Scenic Byway, and Cayahoga Valley Canals Murphy&#x2019;s explains his enthusiasm and philosophy for wandering: &#x201c;I suppose there is a bit of a Kerouac-like romanticism and searching for the meaning of life in most motorcyclists. As was the case with Jack Kerouac in his essay, &#x201c;On The Road,&#x201d; motorcyclists today also seek and enjoy the adventure that being on the road brings. Whether a teenager on a crotch rocket or septuagenarians on full dressers, every biker finds adventure by being on the road while at the same time satisfying a hard-to-explain need to explore beyond familiar horizons, be they physical or mental.&#x201d; Maps, mileage charts, and an appendix filled with emergency phone numbers, major hotel and motel phone numbers, motorcycle repair shops and dealers, and a few pages of fun local rides, makes this compendium indispensable for the back road tourist, either on two wheels or four. William Murphy has been riding Ohio roads for 27 years. His previous book, Motorcycling Across Michigan (Arbutus Press, 2005) is in its second edition.</p><h2>Genesis: The Kabbalistic Bible, Volume One (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>Most people know that Genesis, the first book of the Bible and the first of the Five Books of Moses, tells the story of creation. Lesser-known is the story behind Genesis and how this backstory can be used to connect with a higher realm. Kabbalah teaches that Genesis provides an understanding of the universe on a seed level, and thus its lessons can help seekers reach their full potential. This new rendition of Genesis forms a bridge between the Zohar (Kabbalah's sacred text) and the Torah or Bible. The first in a projected five-volume series (all Five Books of Moses), <i>Genesis</i> is edited by noted scholar and teacher Yehuda Berg and features contributions by legendary Kabbalists Rav Yehuda Ashlag, Rav Yehuda Brandwein, and Rav P. S. Berg. Presented in a handsome hardcover edition, <i>Genesis</i> comes in a user-friendly format, printed front-to-back with the Hebrew and English on facing pages.</p><p>Yehuda Berg, son of Rav Berg and Karen Berg, is a co-director of The Kabbalah Center International and prominent Kabbalistic scholar and teacher. He was recently (March 2007) named one of America&#39;s Top Rabbis in Newsweek Magazine. He speaks and teaches worldwide and his many students include business leaders and celebrities. His previous books include the bestselling titles, The Power of Kabbalah and The 72 Names of God.</p><h2>Scriptural Rosary for Justice &amp; Peace/Re</h2><p>Follow Mary&#39;s example and welcome Jesus into your life as you pray this scriptural rosary for justice and peace.

Latiff, now teaching at the University of Notre Dame, has spent a career in the military researching and developing new combat technologies, observing the cost of our unquestioning embrace of innovation. At its best, advanced technology acts faster than ever to save the lives of soldiers; at its worst, the deployment of insufficiently considered new technology can have devastating unintended or long-term consequences. The question of whether we can is followed, all too infrequently, by the question of whether we should. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Future War,</i> Latiff maps out the changing ways of war and the weapons technologies we will use to fight them, seeking to describe the ramifications of those changes and what it will mean in the future to be a soldier. He also recognizes that the fortunes of a nation are inextricably linked with its national defense, and how its citizens understand the importance of when, how, and according to what rules we fight. What will war mean to the average American? Are our leaders sufficiently sensitized to the implications of the new ways of fighting? How are the attitudes of individuals and civilian institutions shaped by the wars we fight and the means we use to fight them? And, of key importance: How will soldiers themselves think about war and their roles within it? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evolving, complex world of conflict and technology demands that we pay more attention to the issues that will confront us, before it is too late to control them. Decrying what he describes as a "broken" relationship between the military and the public it serves, Latiff issues a bold wake-up call to military planners and weapons technologists, decision makers, and the nation as a whole as we prepare for a very different future.</p><p><b>DR.

From a childhood of gothic proportions in a vicarage on the Welsh borders, through her adolescence, leaving herself teetering on the brink of the 1960s, Sage vividly and wittily brings to life a vanished time and place, and illuminates the lives of three generations of women. Lorna Sage&#39;s memoir of childhood and adolescence is a brilliantly written bravura piece of work, which vividly and wickedly brings to life her eccentric family and somewhat bizarre upbringing in the small town of Hanmer, on the border between Wales and Shropshire. The period as well as the place is evoked with crystal clarity: from the 1940s, dominated for Lorna by her dissolute but charismatic vicar grandfather, through the 1950s, where the invention of fish fingers revolutionised the lives of housewives like Lorna&#39;s mother, to the brink of the 1960s, where the community was shocked by Lorna&#39;s pregnancy at 16, an event which her grandmother blamed on &#39;the fiendish invention of sex&#39;. Bad Blood is often extremely funny, and is at the same time a deeply intelligent insight by a unique literary stylist into the effect on three generations of women of their environment and their relationships.</p><p>Lorna Sage has taught English literature at the University of East Anglia for many years. She is the author of Women in the House of Fiction, a short biography of Angela Carter, and the forthcoming Cambridge Guide To Women&#39;s Writing in English.`Bad Blood is pretty much in a class of its own...

During this period, philosophy was often written in the form of commentaries on the works of Plato and Aristotle. Many ideas wrongly credited to the Middle Ages derive from these centuries, such as that of impetus in dynamics and intentional objects in philosophy of mind. The later Neoplatonist commentators fought a losing battle with Christianity, but inadvertently made Aristotle acceptable to Christians by ascribing to him belief in a Creator God and human immortality. The commentators provide a panorama of up to a thousand years of Greek philosophy, much of which would otherwise be lost. They also serve as the missing link essential for understanding the subsequent history of Western philosophy.</p><p>Volume 1 of this indispensable sourcebook deals with psychology, which for the Neoplatonist commentators was the gateway to metaphysics and theology. It was the subject on which Plato and Aristotle disagreed most, and on which the commentators went furthest beyond them in their search for synthesis. Ethics and religious practice fall naturally under psychology and are included in this volume. All sources appear in English translation and are carefully linked and cross-referenced by editorial comment and explanation. Bibliographies are provided throughout.</p></p><p>Richard Sorabji is Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at King&#39;s College London and an Honorary Fellow at Wolfson College, University of Oxford.

Richard Burridge maintains that imitating Jesus means following both his words -- which are very demanding ethical teachings -- and his deeds and example of being inclusive and accepting of everyone.<br><br> Burridge carefully and systematically traces that combination of rigorous ethical instruction and inclusive community through the letters of Paul and the four Gospels, treating specific ethical issues pertaining to each part of Scripture. The book culminates with a chapter on apartheid as an ethical challenge to reading the New Testament; using South Africa as a contemporary case study enables Burridge to highlight and further apply his previous discussion and conclusions.</p><p>Richard A. Burridge is dean of King&#39;s College London,where he is also professor of biblical interpretation anddirector of New Testament studies.<b>Walter Wink</b><br> &#x2014; Auburn Theological Seminary<br> "In this monumental work Richard Burridge has identified the fundamental question facing South African theology today: How can we insure that apartheid will never happen again? His answer is pertinent to the entire theological world: by following and imitating Jesus. This is the one thing pro-apartheid theology did not do. No imitation of Jesus could justify such violence and oppression or condone schemes of 'separate development' or noninclusivity.&nbsp;<i>Imitating Jesus</i>&nbsp;says it all, but it is only the beginning of the fruitful reward of Burridge's contribution."<br><br><b>Frank J. Matera</b><br> &#x2014; Catholic University of America<br> "The ethical teaching of the New Testament and its normative value remains a central issue for New Testament studies. In this refreshing new book, Richard Burridge employs a narrative-biographical approach to illuminate the ethical teaching of Jesus and to explain how Paul and the Evangelists communicated that teaching through their narrative christologies. Not content with a merely descriptive analysis of the material, Burridge faces the hermeneutical question head-on: how should we apply the moral teaching of the New Testament to our situation today? Comprehensive in scope and in dialogue with the full range of scholarship,&nbsp;<i>Imitating Jesus</i>&nbsp;is one of those rare studies that moves the discipline forward."<br><br><b>David G. Horrell</b><br> &#x2014; University of Exeter<br> "In this major new study of New Testament ethics, Richard Burridge pursues the implications of his influential work on the genre of the Gospels. If they are ancient biographies, then we should not simply focus on the ethical teachings of Jesus, but rather consider how the Gospels present his life, his actions, and his teaching, as an example for his followers to imitate. . . This wide-ranging and thought-provoking study will be of considerable interest to all who are concerned with the ways in which the New Testament's ethics are interpreted and applied by Christians today. In particular it should inform and shape the way in which crucial and heated debates are pursued in the churches, offering a challenging vision of the inclusive practice that should characterize those who are followers of Jesus."<br><br><b>Gerald West</b><br> &#x2014; University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa<br> "The Bible still matters in many contexts. It certainly matters in South Africa, having shaped our history, both from the side of colonialism and apartheid and from the side of our liberation struggle. The South African context therefore provides an important site for Richard Burridge's project. Surrounding his South African case study are an in-depth engagement with the full array of scholarship on New Testament ethics and his own careful reading of particular New Testament texts. But it is the South African site that provides Burridge with an answer to the 'so what?' question. Vast amounts of biblical scholarship stop short of moving beyond a piling up of ancient detail. Burridge goes beyond the detail to risk saying something about how and why the detail matters. And while we in South Africa will derive a special benefit from this study, those in other contexts will also find much that resonates with their own contexts."<br><br><b>Allen Verhey</b><br> &#x2014; Duke Divinity School<br> "Richard Burridge's&nbsp;<i>Imitating Jesus</i>&nbsp;is a welcome addition to the literature on New Testament ethics. I commend it &#x2014; and recommend it &#x2014; for its attention to the story of Jesus as the foundation of New Testament ethics, for its attention to genre, for its emphasis on both the rigorous moral teachings and the radically inclusive acceptance of the New Testament, and for its emphasis on the hermeneutical significance of reading the Bible in an inclusive community."<br><br><b><i>Christian Century</i></b><br> "Burridge engages past scholarship so well and makes such clear, cogent arguments that readers relatively new to the topic will likely find his approach useful."<br><br><b><i>Living Church</i></b><br> "<i>Imitating Jesus</i>&nbsp;is so richly packed with references, quotes, and scriptural analysis that readers interested in the study of ethics &#x2014; or the Bible itself &#x2014; will not leave disappointed. . .&nbsp;<i>Imitating Jesus</i>&nbsp;is accessible and worth a read."</p><h2>Secrets the Pros Won&#39;t Tell You About Winning Hold&#39;em Poker: About Winning Hold&#39;em Poker</h2><p>It takes a special book to take a player to the next level, and <i>this</i> is that book. --Amy Calistri, Poker School Online <br><br> While other highly touted books on hold'em poker offer enough tips to turn a committed beginner into a moderately successful player, none offers the strategies needed to turn an experienced player into a consistent winner--until now.

Loft&#x2019;s books are back, and in Here Was a Man, one of the greatest adventurers of the sixteenth century vividly and romantically comes to life. When young Walter Raleigh first presented himself before Elizabeth I, he dreamt of carving out an empire in the New World to lay at her feet. But Elizabeth is equally determined to keep this handsome, witty young man at her side. Through years of frustration, violent quarrels, reconciliation, and the challenges and rewards of exploration, Raleigh desperately tries to hold on to his dream. Lofts peoples her rich tale with some of the greatest personalities of the age, including Shakespeare, Marlowe, Sir Phillip Sydney, and Sir Francis Drake, painting a detailed portrait of the Elizabethan era in all its colorful, contentious glory. Sweeping readers from the courts of Europe to the jungles of South America, Here Was a Man offers history lovers a feast that only Norah Lofts could deliver.</p><p><b>Norah Lofts</b> was one of the best known and best loved of all historical novelists, renowned for her authentic use of period detail. Born in 1904 in Norfolk, England, Lofts wrote more than fifty books of fiction, nonfiction, and short stories over the course of her half-century-long writing career, including <i>The King's Pleasure</i> and <i>Here Was a Man</i>, and was a bestselling author on both sides of the Atlantic.<p> <b>Chapter One </b><b> </b></p><p><b> Budleigh Point in the County of Devon<br> June 23, 1568</b> </p><blockquote> We've only one virginity to lose,<br> And where we lose it, there our hearts will be. </blockquote> <p> Old Harkess paused in his dragging of the boat to the water's edge, and listened. There were no sounds except the sighing of the summer sea and the swish of the wind through the rough grass at the cliff 's top, and he was not listening for those. He sighed, for he was an old man, and lazy, and a little help with the launching and the rowing was very welcome on these warm nights. He spat on his hands and took a fresh hold on the boat. Twice after that he paused, and the third time heard what he had been waiting for, the quick step, the hurried breathing, and presently the voice calling breathlessly, "Harky, wait for me. Harky." </p><p> Urgent as was the call, it was not loud, and the old man smiled in the darkness; a cautious one, Wally, for all his eagerness. He called back, quietly, "Ahoy, lad." Out of the shadows a figure came stumbling, threw itself silently upon the boat, and with the old man's apparent help, dragged it into the water. As they clambered in the boy said, with reproach in his voice, "I believe you were going without me." </p><p> "I didn't want to. I like a bit of company, as you know. But 'twas getting latish and the nights are short now. I thought they'd kept you in up at the house." </p><p> "They tried. Father locked me in, but thank God I'm still thin enough for the window, and light enough for the wisteria." </p><p> "You won't allust be. What'll you do then?" </p><p> "I'll be gone before then. I'm to go to Oxford this autumn." </p><p> "I shall miss you, Wally." </p><p> "Not as much as I shall you, Harky. Any boy who'll lend you a hand is the same to you. You're Odysseus to me." </p><p> "What's that?" </p><p> "A bald sailor who was always talking." </p><p> "Nice thing to call me!" </p><p> "High praise really. Where're you making for?" </p><p> "Straight out from the Point. 'Tis a French ship with a cargo of best Bordeaux. 'S' pity your father's so set against the night wine, Wally. Many's the cheap drink he might have." </p><p> "Oh, father." The boy's voice was a shrug. "He's got trouble enough without running foul of the Excise men. Devon men are always wrong; they upset Mary by being Protestant, and now Elizabeth is all against the privateering." </p><p> "Only when it's near home, lad. If your father and his friends were busy in the Indies she'd call them the brightest jewels in her crown." </p><p> The word "Indies" struck like a gong in the boy's mind. </p><p> "Here, I'll row, Harky. You take a rest. She'll be heavier coming back." </p><p> Nothing loath the old man drew in his oars and sat back. </p><p> "Why's your father so set against the sea for you, Wally? He's a seaman himself." </p><p> "That's just why. There's nothing in it, he says. I'm to study for the law or the Church, and then look for preferment. Kate Ashley's a cousin of father's, and she has the Queen's ear and will speak for me." </p><p> "Well, no doubt that'd be a steady safe thing to be. But you'd be wasted as a clerk, lad." </p><p> "Maybe. Still, learning can do you no harm. Anyway, I can't be a sailor like Humphrey, I'm always sick at sea. Nights like this are all very well. And oh, but I've a mind to see the Indies and all that vast country beyond them." </p><p> "Ah, it's fair enough, some of it, and rich too. But you ain't so welcome there as you was in my young days. Thick with Spaniards, and the Indians so savage with the treatment they've had that they're waiting behind every tree to put a poisoned arrow through your guts." </p><p> "They'll all be wiped out soon, though. Remember what you were telling me the other night." </p><p> "About the thousands that were driven into the silver mines and never came out again? Yes, I dare say you're right. Still anybody that sets foot in that continent from now on'll have to fight every step, I'm thinking." </p><p> They both fell silent, the old man thinking of the far countries that had held no romance for him, that had been places where one was hungry or thirsty or in danger, and the boy thinking of the far countries too, but as places that drew him as inexplicably as a magnet draws a needle. He knew that Harkess would mock at his thoughts, could he know them. Harky said that four thousand slaves were driven into a silver mine, but he didn't see them in his mind's eye. He couldn't see, in that driving, the gesture of the conqueror. He didn't see the silver delved for by dark slaves from the dark earth, pouring its silver stream into the treasure galleons that sailed with it, stately into Cadiz. He didn't want Harky to think like that. Enough for him to supply the fact, and to leave the image unsullied by his thoughts. And in Harkess's simplicity and realism may have lain the secret of the enormous influence of his casual words upon young Raleigh's life. </p><p> Presently the dark hulk of a ship loomed up; Harkess took his oars again, and they drew alongside carefully. The wine in its roped casks was stowed neatly in the bottom of the boat; money changed hands, a few sentences were spoken in the smugglers' peculiar tongue that was neither French nor English, and Raleigh and Harkess began pulling for the shore. They spoke little, for the laden boat demanded all their care and strength; once Harkess spoke, but only to say, "Second cave, Wally." </p><p> Within about a hundred yards of the shore Raleigh halted his oars and turned his head, listening. Harkess stopped rowing and said quietly, "What is it?" </p><p> "Somebody's at the cave if I'm not mistaken. Can you hear anything?" </p><p> "Hearing's not what it was. But there...there was a light. God's breath, it's that Trebor, he's been on the watch for weeks. We can't land, Wally. We must pull round the Point and hope to get it all under cover at Mother Shale's before morning. If we don't you'll have the pleasure of the sight of me in the stocks. As for you, your father'd..." </p><p> "Flay me," said Raleigh. </p><p> Already there was a hint of coming light in the sky to the east and they bent their backs, working the oars like slaves in the galleys. To get round the Point was always a hard task, currents met there, and at intervals a swirl of frothy water betrayed the presence of hidden rocks. By the time they were round they could see each other, they had both discarded all clothes but their breeches and the sweat was running off them in streams. Once round, however, they were out of sight of whoever had been watching the cave, and stood a reasonable chance of retaining both their cargo and their liberty. Mother Shale's stood in a dip in the cliff, sheltered from view on all sides except that facing the sea. It was a long, low, rambling building which could be alehouse, farm, smugglers' rendezvous or brothel according to who came inquiring. There were always barrels in her cellar, but seldom the same barrels two nights running, and the same might be said of the horses in her stable. </p><p> She herself was a villainous old woman. She bore on her back the marks of a whipping that she had received through the streets of Exeter for being a wanton, long ago. That whipping had put her definitely on the side of the lawbreakers, and many a smuggler, rogue, and wench in trouble had had cause to bless those stripes. </p><p> She came to the window in response to a shower of pebbles sped from Raleigh's hand. Ten words from Harkess informed her of the night's doings and brought her stumbling to the door. In a quarter of an hour the wine was in her cellar, and the boat a foot below the sand in the cove beside the house. Meantime someone within doors had stirred up the ashes of the fire that seldom died completely, and soon Harkess and Raleigh, shivering in the cold morning air, were crouched beside it, wooden platters of fat bacon on their knees, and horn cups of strong ale in their hands. The boy, who had been awake all night and subjected to unusual strain for some hours, could barely stay awake long enough to finish his breakfast. He roused himself for just long enough to say to Harkess, "I must be getting back," but he never heard Harkess reply, "You can't go in that state, lad. And anyhow, you can't get home before they miss you." His head had fallen forward and he was asleep. </p><p> When he woke he became conscious first of the scent of new hay and then of the red glow with which he was surrounded. Then he saw the girl who had waked him looking at him. She had red smiling lips, and she was laughing at him. He sat up quickly and began to pick the hay from his hair and clothes, blushing slightly at the indignity of being caught so by a laughing girl. She laughed again, and catching up a handful of loose hay, tossed it over him, and said, "Sleepyhead. You've been asleep all day. Harkess is having his supper." </p><p> Raleigh scrambled to his feet, shaking the hay from his head, brushing it from his clothes. But the girl was in a teasing mind, and fast as he cleaned himself she tossed more on him. At last, more to gain time than from any desire to play with her, he gathered a great armful and dropped it on her from his superior position on top of the heap. With a little squeal she threw herself on him, the hay flew wildly for several minutes. The red rays of the sunset danced with dust, and at last, spent and breathless, they dropped down beside one another on the tousled mound, and looked at each other, panting. He saw then that she was both older than himself and very pretty. Her hair that was black where it hugged her head had a web of reddish light over it where the loose strands stood up in the sun. Her skin was like honey, and her parted lips showed little white teeth, and a pink, pointed tongue. In her sharp nose and chin lay the threat that in a few years she would be unmistakably old Mother Shale's granddaughter, but for the time being she was lovely. She pouted her lips to blow away a wisp of hair that had fallen over her nose, and then she leaned back, back until she was lying on the hay, with her arms curved above her head. The rolled-up sleeves of her cotton frock revealed the little blue veins that ran, slanting, fr...</p></p><h2>Bali and Angkor (Oxford in Asia Paperbacks)</h2><p>In the early 1930s, Geoffrey Gorer, who had already made his mark with <em>Africa Dances</em> (now reissued in the Penguin Travel Library) went on a three months' trip to Sumatra, Java, Bali, Thailand, and Cambodia. The resulting travelogue, an exciting record, can be read today with great enjoyment and interest. Though recent travel writing about South-East Asia may contain more practical information, what <em>Bali and Angkor</em> lacks in this respect is more than made up for by Gorer's considerable powers of observation and his interest in interpreting the role that art and religion play in the life of the Balinese and the Khmers.</p><p></p><h2>The Winds of Change: Climate, Weather, and the Destruction of Civilizations</h2><p>A concise history of significant world events that occurred as a direct result of climate changes describes lost societies in Greenland, central America, and central Africa, in a cautionary account that evaluates the present world&#39;s readiness for threatening climate changes. By the author of The Octopus and the Orangutan. 35,000 first printing</p><p><b>Eugene Linden</b> is the author of seven books and for many years wrote about global environmental issues for <i>Time.</i> He has contributed to <i>The New York Times, Foreign Affairs, National Geographic, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, Fortune,</i> and <i>Slate.</i> Linden has won numerous journalistic awards, including the American Geophysical Union?s Walter Sullivan Award. He was named by Yale University in 2001 as a Poynter Fellow in honor of his work in environmental journalism. He lives in Washington, D.C.Linden, who has been writing about the environment for 20 years (<i>The Future in Plain Sight</i>), is angry that, despite compelling scientific consensus, American politicians aren't facing up to the climate change that is upon us, and he's frustrated that the public isn't forcing them to do so. Such slowpoke acceptance of an inevitability, Linden argues in this articulate polemic, is rooted in the fact that "it has been our good fortune to prosper... during one of the most benign climate periods"&#x2014;but one that, if past worldwide weather cycles do portend the future, is fast coming to an end, with severe cultural and political consequences. Linden draws his conclusion from millennia of historical evidence, including the relatively recent Little Ice Age, starting in the 14th century, that wiped out Norse settlers in Greenland; more recently, a fierce El Ni�o in 1876&#x2013;1878 precipitated droughts that killed millions, and another in 1997&#x2013; 1998&#x2014;the most powerful ever recorded and a "taste of things to come"&#x2014;cost the world economy $100 billion. Several chapters explaining the science of climate change will be hard going for lay readers, but the author's passion for the world to comprehend a coming catastrophe helps propel his alarming narrative.

In it, Ackroyd takes readers from William of Orange&#39;s accession following the Glorious Revolution to the Regency, when the flamboyant Prince of Wales ruled in the stead of his mad father, George III, and England was - again -at war with France, a war that would end with the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. Late Stuart and Georgian England marked the creation of the great pillars of the English state. The Bank of England was founded, as was the stock exchange, the Church of England was fully established as the guardian of the spiritual life of the nation and parliament became the sovereign body of the nation with responsibilities and duties far beyond those of the monarch. It was a revolutionary era in English letters, too, a time in which newspapers first flourished and the English novel was born. It was an era in which coffee houses and playhouses boomed, gin flowed freely and in which shops, as we know them today, began to proliferate in our towns and villages. But it was also a time of extraordinary and unprecedented technological innovation, which saw England utterly and irrevocably transformed from a country of blue skies and farmland to one of soot and steel and coal.</p><p></p><h2>Blood on the Altar: The Secret History of the World&#39;s Most Dangerous Secret Society</h2><p><b>Publisher's Statement Concerning <i>Blood on the Altar</i></b>.

This book takes children into a magical time and place in Huichol Indian folklore where newly-created beings were evolving into the creatures they were meant to be and finding the habitats they were meant to enjoy. According to tradition, these early ancestors of today's forest-dwellers had human characteristics, physical as well as emotional; hence they were sometimes referred to as animal people. This concept of animal people is very appealing to children as well as easily and intuitively understood by them. This delightful folktale shows how Turtle Person learned to be patient; how Squirrel Person learned to find safety in high places; and, how Wolf Person learned not allow greed to block his common sense - all important survival skills for each of these animals today. While enjoying an animal tale filled with bits of wisdom and humour, children will be able to learn some lessons about the interdependence of all living things and the natural environment. The brilliantly-coloured illustrations are from Indigenous yarn paintings called cuadros, created by applying beeswax and pine pitch to a board then carefully applying the yarn. The artist, Modesto Rivera Lemos, created the yarn paintings specifically to illustrate this story. Each page is written in both English and Spanish, giving children the ability to read in either language, or both, providing another learning opportunity. Children will also absorb some of the Huichol cultural and spiritual heritage from this traditional folktale. Adults as well will enjoy the astonishing beauty of the illustrations and the simple yet profound truths reflected in "When Animals Were People".</p><p>&#34;Bright, intricate, and kinetic [the illustrations] carry the story entirely on their own, and will fascinate children with both their antic quality and textured appearance. A brief description of the process the artist uses appears at the end of the book, and could well serve to inspire art projects.&#34; --School Library Journal</p><h2>A Drizzle of Honey: The Life and Recipes of Spain&#39;s Secret Jews</h2><p>When Iberian Jews were converted to Catholicism under duress during the Inquisition, many struggled to retain their Jewish identity in private while projecting Christian conformity in the public sphere. To root out these heretics, the courts of the Inquisition published checklists of koshering practices and "grilled" the servants, neighbors, and even the children of those suspected of practicing their religion at home. From these testimonies and other primary sources, Gitlitz &amp; Davidson have drawn a fascinating, award-winning picture of this precarious sense of Jewish identity and have re-created these recipes, which combine Christian &amp; Islamic traditions in cooking lamb, beef, fish, eggplant, chickpeas, and greens and use seasonings such as saffron, mace, ginger, and cinnamon. The recipes, and the accompanying stories of the people who created them, promise to delight the adventurous palate and give insights into the foundations of modern Sephardic cuisine.<br></p><p>David Gitlitz and Linda Kay Davidson are professors at the University of Rhode Island. Each has written several books on Spanish culture, including <i>Gitlitz's Secrecy </i>and <i>Deceit</i>, an alternate selection of the History Book Club and winner of the 1996 National Jewish Book Award for Sephardic Studies and the 1997 Lucy B. Dawidowicz Prize for History. They are married and this is the first book they have written together. Their newest book is <i>The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago</i>, now available from St. Martin's Press.<br>A Drizzle of Honey<br><i>Recipes, Stories &amp; Commentary</i><i>Salads and</i> <i>Vegetables</i>Salads tend to be eaten raw, while vegetables are usually cooked, but the line of demarcation between the two has always been a thin one. Beets, peas, and spinach, for example, are served both cold and hot; they can stand alone as a main dish or be mixed with other ingredients. Lettuce can be eaten cold in a salad or fried in oil, and its stalks can be boiled with lots of sugar to make a conserve.1Spanish culinary traditions and terminology complicate matters further. Spanish categories overlap: an <i>hierba</i> is a grass or an herb; a <i>legumbre</i> is a vegetable, but especially a legume; <i>verdura</i> gives the sense of something green; while an <i>hortaliza</i> is almost anything that grows in the <i>huerta,</i> or garden. All of these terms were used in the Middle Ages, sometimes interchangeably. Enrique de Villena's <i>Arte cisoria</i> (<i>The Art of Carving</i>) lists twenty <i>"yerbas,"</i> including thistle, carrots, lettuce, turnips, onions, garlic, borage, purslane, fennel, caraway, and mustard.2 The seventeenth-century dictionary writer Covarrubiaseven uses the same two examples--lettuce and radishes--to illustrate two different categories, <i>verduras</i> and <i>hortalizas.</i> For Covarrubias, the <i>legumbre</i> has fruit that develops in a pod, while <i>hierba</i> denotes produce without stalks that can be either cooked in stews or served raw in salads.3In the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, salads must have been ubiquitous. The occasional references suggest that they included a wider variety of ingredients than are common today. Covarrubias defines "salad" (<i>ensalada</i>) as "different herbs, meats, salted [ingredients], fish, olives, conserves, condiments [,] egg yolks, borage, sugared almonds, and a great diversity of things ... ."4 He also tells us that its name derives from the custom of sprinkling the miscellany with salt (<i>sal</i>).5 The single salad recipe in the late fourteenth-century cookbook from the kitchens of English King Richard II lists more than a dozen different ingredients, including some still-common greens and herbs such as parsley, garlic, onions, and watercress, and others not quite so common: fennel, leeks, borage, mint, rue, and purslane.6 Renaissance literary references tell us about "sliced lettuces and carrots with oregano"7 and "onion ... artichoke ... and chopped cucumber."8 Sources such as these suggest that anything green and edible raw could be thrown into a salad, but that a salad was not limited to greens. Other ingredients depended only on what was seasonably available. In the temperate regions of the Iberian Peninsula, including the humid north where varieties of chard are common, people could count on salad greens during much of the year. Though rarely cited, seasonal varieties of lettuce were undoubtedly common in salads. People then believed that lettuce contained properties that calmed lust and thus it was the symbol for continence.9No matter what went into the salad, salt, vinegar, and oil were its constant dressing, and this is still the norm on the Spanish table. The account ledger of a sixty-eight-day journey in 1352 from Estella to Seville lists the purchase of vinegar on forty-three occasions generally accompanying some reference to salad makings, such as lettuce, radishes, and rocket. According to a Spanish proverb, "To make a good salad, four men are needed: for the salt, a wise man; for the oil, a prodigal man; for the vinegar, a stingy man; and to mix it, a crazy man ... ."10 Granado's recipe for cooked white beans insists that if they are to be served as a salad one must add vinegar and oil.11Elsewhere during the rest of the year, people largely consumed cabbage and root vegetables such as carrots, parsnips, and turnips. One popular proverb states, "There's nothing better than turnips with cabbage."12 Radishes were so common that they gave their name to several Iberian towns, such as the Salamancan and Leonese Rabanal. Other proverbs substantiate the radish's popularity: "A tender radish, no matter the size, isgood" and "There is no good life without radishes and candles."13 Covarrubias adds that radishes help people suffering from jaundice.14The list of vegetables common in Roman Iberia was expanded when the Muslims introduced Eastern products, notably the chickpea and the eggplant.15 The <i>Al-Andalus</i> cookbook gives a good sense of the vegetables commonly consumed in Islamic Spain. Its "garden recipe" is for a green dish to be made from whatever happened to be in the garden. The author lists for summer: chard, squash, eggplant, fennel, and melon; for spring he suggests lettuce, fennel, fresh beans, spinach, chard, and cilantro. The directions make clear that any combination of these also could be used to make a vegetable broth which was thickened with eggs.16 The vegetables mentioned in the rest of his book, such as cauliflower, turnips, artichokes, squash, and spinach, are generally a part of a stew or a seasoning for meat. One notable departure is an emphasis on the eggplant, for which the <i>Al-Andalus</i> cookbook offers more than a dozen recipes.A common characteristic of medieval cookbooks has been thought to be the scant attention they give to vegetables as stand-alone foods.17 However, two Christian Iberian cookbooks, <i>Sent sov�</i> and Granado's, devote space to Lenten dishes featuring vegetables, usually prepared as thick stews. In fact, Granado devotes an entire section to vegetable stews (<i>escudillas de yeruas</i>), with individual recipes for borage, chard, spinach, lettuce, chicory, malva, asparagus, squash, and chickpeas, some of which are made with meat broth and others with almond milk.18 We also find recipes for artichokes, asparagus, leeks, squash, cabbage, and mushrooms.The medieval table included whatever was edible in its season. In addition, some vegetables were stored, or preserved, for later consumption when it was too cold for the greens to grow. We may infer that greens and legumes growing around the house were not highly prized, but they were eaten and probably eaten in great quantities, especially on non-meat days in the Christian calendar.19Jews and crypto-Jews shared the taste for salads and vegetables. There is no reason to believe that the salads eaten by the crypto-Jews differed in any way from those eaten by their old-Christian neighbors. On the other hand, based on the frequency of references specifically associating them with Iberian Jews, eggplant, greens like chard, and chickpeas, combining equally well with meat, fish, and fowl, seem to have been defining characteristics of medieval Sephardic vegetable cuisine.<i>Juana N��ez's Lechugas Y R�banos</i><i>Lucia Fern�ndez</i> <i>alleged that for</i> <i>lunch Juana N��ez</i> <i>used to give them</i> <i>"lettuce and</i> <i>radishes and</i> <i>cheese and cress</i> <i>and other things</i> <i>she does not</i> <i>remember</i>."20Juana Nunez and her husband, Juan de Teva, a clothing merchant, practiced crypto-Judaism in Ciudad Real in the early sixteenth century. When the Inquisition's curiosity focused on the couple, Juan fled to Portugal. The Spanish Inquisition tried him in absentia and burned his effigy on September 7, 1513.21 Juana was arrested on March 3, 1512, and her trial dragged on for two and a half years. Juana got along poorly with her neighbors, and the pettiness of their squabbles is evident in the malice with which they shared gossip about her with the Inquisition.Malice aside, their testimony is rich in details about Juana's crypto-Jewish customs. For example, Juana and her closest women friends used to fast during daylight hours on Mondays and Thursdays. According to one neighbor, in the afternoons when Juana's sons Hernandico (twelve years old) and Antonito (thirteen years old) came home from school, to show their respect they would kiss their mother's hand in the Jewish fashion, and she would put her hand on their heads and draw it down across their faces, but without making the sign of the cross.Above all, Juana tended to keep the Sabbath fully, on Friday sweeping and scrubbing her house, preparing food to be kept warm until Saturday, and taking a bath with her crypto-Jewish friends Maria Gonzalez and Luisa Fern�ndez and their daughters. She heated water in a large tub, into which she sprinkled rosemary and orange peels. After the bath, according to her servant Lucia Fern�ndez, wife of the shepherd Francisco de Lillo, she used to hop straight into bed with her husband without quarreling the way they did on other weeknights. She had several strategies to abstain from working during the Sabbath. Again according to Lucia, her favorite was to pretend she had a headache and to throw herself down on some pillows until Saturday afternoon, when she routinely recovered and invited her women friends to her house for a social late afternoon to talk and snack and make jokes about the Catholic mass. It was at these Sabbath gatherings that Juana used to serve this salad.The Inquisition found Juana guilty of Judaizing, but because so many of the prosecution witnesses were shown to be biased against her, Juana's sentence was relatively light: to remain under house arrest, to wear the penitential San Benito robe, to abstain from wearing jewelry or any adornment, and to make confession a minimum of three times annually. Ten months later, at Juana's petition, even these minor sentences were commuted.<i>Juana N��ez's Lettuce and Radish Salad</i>Serves 4-6Salad<i>1--2 ounces watercress</i> <i>1/2 head green lettuce</i> <i>2 cups torn-up other greens, such as a</i> <i>combination of radicchio, red lettuce,</i> <i>romaine, endive, or fennel</i> <i>1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint</i> <i>3--4 radishes, sliced</i> <i>1--2 ounces grated hard cheese, such as</i> <i>Romano or Manchego</i> <i>1--2 teaspoons coarsely ground sea salt</i>Dressing<i>1--2 teaspoons balsamic, cider, or red wine vinegar</i><i>3 tablespoons olive oil</i>1.

Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well before serving, or pass a cruet at the table.<i>Mar�a S�nchez's Verduras</i><i>Maria S�nchez</i> <i>testified that on</i> <i>Saturday in</i> <i>Guadalupe she</i> <i>had seen "lots of</i> <i>conversa women</i> <i>sitting by the doors</i> <i>of their houses</i> <i>eating greens</i> <i>with vinegar.</i>"22Mar�a Sanchez, the widow of the butcher Diego Ximenez of Guadalupe, was herself tried in 1485--86. The most damaging testimony came from her daughter Ines, who was also a prisoner. She told inquisitors that her mother had most likely confessed to all their Judaizing customs except three: that after the baptism of her son Diego she had scrubbed off the chrism; that she frequently donated oil for the lamps in the synagogue in Trujillo; and that she had taken the crucifix that her now-deceased husband had hung at the foot of their bed and had thrown it in the privy. Ines reported that when she went into her mother's cell she found her despondent, moaning that she would be killed for what she had confessed. Ines said that she had asked her mother if she had mentioned the crucifix to the inquisitors, to which Maria replied, "Daughter, nobody knows it but you; so tell me if you talked about it, for if you didn't I won't say anything."23 The fact that we have this datum proves that this attempt at collusion failed.A principal witness against Maria was a serving girl who had become a confidante of one of Maria's daughters. The daughter explained to her in great detail how in the time before the founding of the Inquisition the local crypto-Jewish community was accustomed to observing the Sabbath, and how in the afternoons they used to gather in the doorway of someone's house to talk and munch on greens with vinegar.Mar�a went to the stake on November 20, 1486.24&nbsp;<br>We have seen that the Spanish term <i>verdura</i> encompasses any edible green grown in the garden. The greens could have been eaten raw or cooked, sprinkled with vinegar or, perhaps, vinegar and oil. It is common in modern-day Spain to sprinkle vinegar over cooked green vegetables such as chard. Because we already have a number of clear references to salads that were eaten with vinegar, we have opted to interpret this reference to greens as a vegetable dish. Since we cannot be sure if the greens were cooked or not, we offer two recipes for this dish.<i>Mar�a S�nchez's Greens</i><i>As a cold Dish</i>Serves 4<i>1 large bunch of greens (see Variations)</i> <i>2 tablespoons other finely chopped</i> <i>fresh green herbs (see Variations)</i> <i>1--2 tablespoons balsamic or red</i> <i>vinegar</i> <i>1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground sea salt</i>1. Wash the greens and pat them dry. Cut them into bite-size pieces and place them and the herbs in a large bowl. You should have about 8 cups.2. Sprinkle with the vinegar and sea salt.3. Mix well and serve.<i>As a Hot Dish</i>Serves 4<i>1 large bunch of greens (see Variations)</i> <i>1--3 tablespoons olive oil</i> <i>2 tablespoons other finely chopped</i> <i>fresh green herbs (see Variations)</i> <i>1--2 tablespoons balsamic or red</i> <i>vinegar</i> <i>1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground sea salt</i>1. Wash the greens and pat them dry. Chop them into medium-size pieces.2. In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Toss in the greens and herbs and stir-fry briefly Sprinkle the vinegar over the greens and stir it in. Continue to fry just until the vinegar has been absorbed, about 2 or 3 minutes.3. Sprinkle with the salt and serve immediately.VARIATIONSAny green or combination of flavorful greens is possible. It is best to balance peppery or spicy flavors, like turnip, lovage, or mustard greens, with more bland ones, such as lettuces, radicchio, or spinach.The herbs add diversity to the greens. Here are some possibilities:<i>2 tablespoons chopped chives or onions</i> <i>1 teaspoon chopped fresh marjoram</i> <i>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano</i> <i>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh dill or fennel</i> <i>1 tablespoon chopped nasturtium leaves</i> <i>2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil</i><i>Mar�a Alvarez's Acelgas Ahogadas en Aceite</i><i>In the Sorian city of</i> <i>Almaz�n in 1505,</i> <i>Mar�a Alvarez</i> <i>allegedly prepared</i> <i>"Swiss chard,</i> <i>parboiling it in water</i> <i>and then frying it</i> <i>with onions in oil,</i> <i>and then boiling it</i> <i>again in the oil.</i> <i>And then she threw</i> <i>in water and grated</i> <i>bread crumbs and</i> <i>spices and egg</i> <i>yolks; and she</i> <i>cooked it until it got</i> <i>very thick."25</i>Medieval recipes generally distinguished between spices, herbs, and greens. Greens grew locally and were eaten as what we today term "vegetables," generally in meat stews.

In examining why, historian David Clay Large begins in Munich four decades before World War I and finds a proto-fascist cultural heritage that proved fertile soil later for Hitler's movement. An engrossing account of the time and place that launched Hitler on the road to power.</strong></p> Munich was the birthplace of Nazism and became the chief cultural shrine of the Third Reich. In exploring the question of why Nazism flourished in the 'Athens of the Isar', David Clay Large has written a compelling account of the cultural roots of the Nazi movement, allowing us to see that the conventional explanations for the movement's rise are not enough. Large's account begins in Munich's 'golden age', four decades before World War I, when the city's artists and writers produced some of the outstanding work of the modernist spirit. He sees a dark side to the city, a protofascist cultural heritage that would tie Adolf Hitler's movement to its soul. Large prowls his volatile world of seamy basement meeting places, finding that attacks on modernity and liberalism flourished, along with virulent anti-Semitism and German nationalism. From the violent experience of the Munich Soviet, through Hitler's failed Beer-Hall Putsch of 1923 and on to his appointment as German chancellor in 1933, Large unfurls a narrative full of insight and implication.</p><p>David Clay Large is a professor at the Fromm Institute, University of San Francisco, and a Senior Fellow at the Institute of European Studies, U.C. Berkeley. A specialist on the history of Modern Europe, especially Germany and Austria, Large is the author of ten books including Berlin, Where Ghosts Walked: Munich&#x2019;s Road to the Third Reich, and Nazi Games.An American historian explores the interplay of culture and politics that favored the rise of Hitler in the city he transformed into the headquarters of the Nazi movement. Large (History/Montana State Univ.), author of five previous books about modern German history and editor of another two, is one of the figures helping to reestablish narrative history as an intellectually respectable genre. His new book tells the story of Munich as the scene of Nazism's birth and rise. When Hitler--who had failed to establish himself as an artist in Vienna--arrived in Munich in 1913, the city had a reputation for bohemian and avant-garde culture, which accommodated Hitler's image of himself as a rebel. But he also thought of the city as an emphatically German setting, as opposed to international and multiethnic Vienna. Against the background of this inner contradiction in Munich's double identity--xenophobic backwater and progressive metropolis- -Large constructs his grim tale, which includes Munich's violent experiment in communism (191819), Hitler's thwarted Beer Hall Putsch (1923), and his brutal rise to the German chancellorship in Berlin (1933). His tale ends with the entry of American soldiers into the defeated Bavarian capital, but Large also appends an epilogue in which he ponders, among other things, the Allies' problematical policy of ``denazification.'' According to Large, General Patton, the military governor of Munich and Bavaria, believed that denazification was ill advised, for ``ex-Nazis no longer presented a danger in comparison with the communists. Postwar Allied policy, he declared, was persecuting `a pretty good race' and opening German lands to `Mongolian savages.' '' Eisenhower relieved Patton of his duty, but his policy of tolerance toward former Nazis prevailed. A readable, informative, and solid book. Large does not startle us with new discoveries or ideas, but he does look at this piece of history from a unifying perspective that is both illuminating and significant.

It is an evocation of an American scene. Tom Clark has written not only a life of Damon Runyon - a completely original and engaging figure - but also a story of Runyon&#39;s times, of the world he inhabited. The author follows Runyon from his anarchic and lonely youth during the last days of the Old West to success and notoriety in a world of Broadway haunts, fight rings, press boxes, floating card games, speakeasies, ten-dollar windows at Pimlico and Saratoga, nights at the Colony and the Stork Club. In this world there are characters fixed in legend - Al Capone, Jack Dempsey, Jimmy Walker, Nick the Greek - and a street population of rogues and mugs. In his more than three decades as a columnist and sports reporter, Runyon developed a distinctive style: he had an incomparable ear and deep appreciation for the &#39;roar of the town.&#39; Runyon&#39;s writing, such as Guys and Dolls, offers a unique vision of America during the era of &#39;Wonderful Nonsense.&#39; Clark captures the intricacies of Runyon&#39;s complicated temperament and personality: sociable and iconoclastic, dapper and sensitive, pleasant and irascible, detached and generous. The glamorous events of Runyon&#39;s public life are contrasted to the private upheavals: the erased children and vanished wives, the struggle with final illness. Clark describes this book as &#39;biography by association.&#39; It is a vivid account: the era was deeply alive and Runyon, the acute, ironic observer, is one of its most enduring symbols.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Poetry of Lucy Maud Montgomery</h2><p>The poems in this collection by Lucy Maud Montgomery were written to reach the readers she thought of as &#34;kindred spirits&#34; - those thousands of people who then, as now, would be as deeply moved as she was by beauty in nature and in spirit. She felt herself drenched with beauty. It was an emotion that evolves heart-deep recognition in readers who will find an echo of their own yearnings and hungers for emotional outlet. Maud Montgomery was well aware that greatness as a poet was beyond her reach, but her verses were capable of putting into words what ordinary people felt and often could not explain. They express the sense of awe and delight arising from the simple human experiences of all that is lovely in the world. &#34;I&#39;ve written one real poem out of my heart,&#34; she confided to a friend in a week when she had sent off several verses she knew to be pot-boilers. But even these held a small kernel of thought, of appreciation, of gratitude for the gift of natural beauty. The poems in this collection will reach as deeply into the heart of today&#39;s readers as they did in those who first read them half a century ago. Critics are now finding new insights and much genuine ability in Montgomery&#39;s poetry, but the poems remain poems for people. She wrote for people who hunger for a way to give voice to their deepest thoughts and emotions. She wrote as an artist paints, in vivid scenes with vivid colours. Her verses are clearly defined gem-like vignettes depicting familiar scenes beloved by all the friends of the earth. She writes of clouds and sky, the clash and thunder of waves on a seashore, the scents of garden and woodland, the kinship of humanity with whatever gods there be. The qualities of simplicity and earnestness are not to be spurned. While ordinary people can respond to these eternal truths, Montgomery&#39;s poems will continue to be read and treasured.</p><p><p> Ferns McCabe is a Fitzhenry and Whiteside author. </p></p><h2>War</h2><p>Explores the different aspects of war: its causes, methods, endings, and justifications - and along the way demolishes many current myths about war and peace.</p><p>In the tradition of Clausewitz and Machiavelli, two distinguished scholars explore every aspect of war: its causes, methods, endings, and justifications--and along the way demolish many current myths about war and peace.ANGELO CODEVILLA is a professor of international relations at Boston University and the author of THE CHARACTER OF NATIONS, among other works.

Calling upon Nyame, the God of All Things, Anansi solves his predicament in a touching and highly resourceful fashion.In adapting this popular folktale, Gerald McDermott merges the old with the new, combining bold, rich color with traditional African design motifs and authentic Ashanti language rhythms.</p><p>Anansi the Spider is a wise, funny, mischievous, and loveable folk hero who pops up in traditional Ashanti tales from Ghana, in West Africa. This story, retold and illustrated by Gerald McDermott, relates the tale of father Anansi and his six spider sons. When Anansi sets out on a dangerous journey and gets into all sorts of trouble, each son does one thing to help, and all their efforts together save their father. He finds a mysterious, beautiful globe of light in the forest, and decides to make it a gift of thanks. But which son should receive the prize? Even with the help of Nyame, the God of All Things, he can't decide, so Nyame takes the great globe up into the sky, and that's where it has stayed ever since--the moon, for all to see. This profound story reaches children of many ages; younger ones see it as an exciting rescue story, but older children are intrigued by the larger themes of cooperation and "the whole being more than its parts." <p> <i>Anansi the Spider</i>, McDermott's first book, received immediate acclaim and was named a Caldecott Honor Book.

The military never lost a battle, how then did it not win the war? <br><br>Stepping back from this overheated fray, bestselling author John Prados takes a fresh look at both the war and the debates about it to produce a much-needed and long-overdue reassessment of one of our nation's most tragic episodes. Drawing upon several decades of research-including recently declassified documents, newly available presidential tapes, and a wide range of Vietnamese and other international sources&#x2014;Prados's magisterial account weaves together multiple perspectives across an epic-sized canvas where domestic politics, ideologies, nations, and militaries all collide. <br><br>Prados patiently pieces back together the events and moments, from the end of World War II until our dispiriting departure from Vietnam in 1975, that reveal a war that now appears to have been truly unwinnable&#x2014;due to opportunities lost, missed, ignored, or refused. He shows how&#x2014;from the Truman through the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations&#x2014;American leaders consistently ignored or misunderstood the realities in Southeast Asia and passed up every opportunity to avoid war in the first place or avoid becoming ever more mired in it after it began. Highlighting especially Ike's seminal and long-lasting influence on our Vietnam policy, Prados demonstrates how and why our range of choices narrowed with each passing year, while our decision-making continued to be distorted by Cold War politics and fundamental misperceptions about the culture, psychology, goals, and abilities of both our enemies and our allies in Vietnam. <br><br>By turns engaging narrative history, compelling analytic treatise, and moving personal account, Prados's magnum opus challenges previous authors and should rightfully take its place as the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and accurate one-volume account of a war that&#x2014;judging by the frequent analogies to the current war in Iraq&#x2014;has not yet really ended for any of us.</p><p>"Prados has given us a great gift--a fresh, original, and fascinating synthesis of a long and complicated war by one of the nation's foremost experts."--Christian G.

Now, as we feel our hatred for them, we find it difficult to understand how they could have been so powerful, how they could have appealed so strongly to millions of people of a modern age.<br><br>To understand our own times, it is necessary to understand these movements. And to understand them, we must read the basic philosophical and political documents which show the force of the ideas which moved a world to the brink of disaster.<br><br>This collection of readings has been selected to encourage students to clarify their thinking on social philosophy. They will accordingly need to determine whether the readings contain more or less coherent body of ideas which constitutes a social philosophy. They will also need to raise the more far-reaching question of whether the ideas are acceptable. To arrive at any satisfactory answer to this latter question, they will necessarily have to compare the ideas of fascism and their practical meanings with the alternatives, real and ideal, that are the substance of live philosophical issues.</p><p></p><h2>Qigong For Women</h2><p>� Low-impact, time-efficient exercises that relieve stress, restore physical health, and rebalance the mind.<br><br>� Provides step-by-step instructions, with accompanying photos, for dozens of exercises specifically designed for women.<br><br>� 300 black-and-white photographs.<br><br>� Addresses concerns specific to women's health, including special sections on female sexuality, osteoporosis, stress, and pregnancy.<br><br>� Techniques developed and perfected over the course of 2,000 years by Taoist and Buddhist monks and doctors.<br><br>In today's high-powered world, women frequently find themselves pulled in many different directions. As they try to balance the demands of careers and family life, they are too often left with a feeling of imbalance, a feeling that can manifest in both physical and emotional stress. To reclaim their equilibrium and find relief, more and more women are turning to qigong, a low-impact, time-efficient daily practice of gentle exercises based on the ancient concept of acupuncture meridians. Developed and enriched over two thousand years by Taoist and Buddhist doctors and monks, chi kung offers techniques for improving breath control and mental concentration, releasing stress through self-administered massage and acupressure, and reaching and maintaining desired weight. <br><br>In <i>Qigong for Women</i>, Dominique Ferraro gives step-by-step instructions, accompanied by photos, for dozens of exercises that address the specific concerns of women.

Through regular practice of chi kung, women can improve blood circulation, reinforce the immune system, and reestablish emotional equilibrium. Middle-aged and older women will enjoy the added benefits of recovering elasticity, whether in their joints or in their psyches. Valuable for all ages, <i>Qigong for Women </i>provides a system, both preventive and curative, to maintain the sense of well-being that we all deserve.</p><p>Dominique Ferraro lives in Milan, Italy, where she teaches qigong."<i>Qigong for Women</i> is essential reading for both novice and experienced female practitioners of Qigong and will prove of immense interest and value to students of alternative health and medicine practices."

Two decades of wins and losses, warm-ups and strikeouts, game after game after game. But there was one thing Tyler had never accomplished.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d never been perfect.<br> <br>Until now.<br> <br>Tyler adjusted his Blue Wahoos cap and dug the toe of his shoe into the soft dirt of the pitcher&#x2019;s mound at the Pensacola Bayfront Stadium. Redemption was at hand. Bent at the waist, the ball an extension of his arm, Tyler stared down the next batter. Nearly five thousand fans screamed beneath the lights on this beautiful August evening.<br> <br>Here . . . now . . . Tyler actually felt perfect.<br> <br>As if tonight even the ghosts of his past were cheering for him.<br> <br>His heart slammed around in his chest as he reeled back and released a pitch. Ninety miles an hour, he thought. At least ninety.<br> <br>&#x201c;Strike!&#x201d; The umpire stood and pumped his right arm. &#x201c;One ball, two strikes!&#x201d;<br> <br>One more, Tyler caught the ball from the catcher. Just one. A breeze blew in from the bay, but Tyler couldn&#x2019;t stop sweating. Breathe, Ames. Just breathe. They were the words he told himself every time the game got tense. He dragged his arm over his forehead, stood straight up on the mound, and took a deep breath.<br> <br>One more strike. Tyler squinted at the catcher&#x2019;s signals. The dance was as old as the game: catcher signaling the pitch, pitcher waiting for the right signal, the pitch he wanted to throw. The signal came.<br> <br>No. Tyler shook his head. Not that one. The catcher changed signals. Again Tyler shook his head. The third signal made Tyler smile. At least on the inside.<br> <br>The change-up. Perfect pitch for this batter, this moment.<br> <br>Tyler glanced at the stands. Four scouts from the Cincinnati Reds were here. If things went well he could bypass triple A and join the Big Leagues. As early as next week. The Majors. His dream since winning the Little League World Series twelve years ago. Six years making minimum wage, trekking around down South on a bus would all be worth it after tonight. He could do it. He had never pitched like this.<br> <br>Not in all his life.<br> <br>Tyler wound up and released the pitch. It flew from his hands like a blazing fastball, but halfway to the plate it braked. The batter&#x2014;a new third-round pick out of Texas&#x2014;swung early. Way early.<br> <br>&#x201c;Strike three!&#x201d;<br> <br>Tyler jogged toward home and high-fived his catcher, William Trapnell. Six innings, eighteen straight batters. Fourteen strikeouts. Three ground-outs to first. One caught fly ball. Jep Black, the Blue Wahoos manager, met him at the dugout. &#x201c;Got someone to hit for you, Tyler.&#x201d; He patted his back. &#x201c;Rest your arm.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tyler nodded and took a spot at the end of the bench. This was his second season with the Blue Wahoos, and though the roster changed constantly, he generally liked his teammates. Several of them shouted congratulations.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re perfect tonight, Ames.&#x201d; William swigged down a water bottle, breathless. &#x201c;You own this.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tyler gave him a thumbs-up. &#x201c;Thanks. Keep it up.&#x201d; He volleyed a couple more compliments, slid a jacket over his pitching arm, and leaned back. He could relax this inning with the designated hitter taking over.<br> <br>He closed his eyes and filled his lungs with the ocean air. Hadn&#x2019;t he known this would happen? When he got moved up from the Dayton A team last spring he had expected great things.<br> <br>Tyler blinked and stared at home plate. The first Blue Wahoos batter was up. Tyler worked the muscles in his hand, making a fist and releasing it. His team was at the top of the lineup. Plenty of time. Tyler squinted at the distant lights, the sponsor signs on the outfield walls. Like a grainy YouTube clip, the seasons ran together in his mind. Star of the 2002 Little League World Series. In high school, California&#x2019;s Mr. Baseball. Most recruited pitcher in the history of UCLA.<br> <br>How had it all gone so wrong?<br> <br>The fallout with his parents, his back injury, the public drunkenness charges, the girls. He had fallen out of grace with his fans and everyone he loved.<br> <br>Sami Dawson most of all. Her name made his heart hurt. Sami, girl . . . where are you? What happened to us? He closed his eyes again. He had loved her more than life. But that was a hundred years ago.<br> <br>Cheers interrupted his personal highlight reel. He opened his eyes and watched their centerfielder hit a triple. Blue Wahoos up, 3&#x2013;0. He massaged his right arm. It was sore, but a whole lot better than usual. He had three more innings in him. Definitely.<br> <br>A picture filled his mind. He and Sami, both of them seventeen, sitting together on her grandparents&#x2019; roof. Aww, Sami. We thought we had forever back then. The stars had looked brighter that night, the silhouette of the trees like something from a dream. No one had believed in him more than Sami Dawson.<br> <br>What was I thinking? How could I let you go?<br> <br>Tyler gritted his teeth. Tonight was where it would all turn around. He would Google his own name tomorrow and see something different. Tyler Ames: Perfect. Story after story would say the same thing. He&#x2019;d made it. Finally found his way. He would be perfect and everyone would know. Maybe even Sami.<br> <br>Buried would be all the headlines still there at the moment.<br> <br>Tyler Ames: The Kid Who Didn&#x2019;t Live Up to His Potential.<br> <br>Minor League Purgatory: The Story of Tyler Ames.<br> <br>The Sad Life of Tyler Ames: Mr. Baseball, Mr. Joke.<br> <br>Tyler exhaled. The pain of his past was as close as the nearest computer. Any kid with a cell phone could read about the hero he&#x2019;d been.<br> <br>And the failure he&#x2019;d become.<br> <br>Every game, every inning of the past few years was like an act of penance now, a way to absolve himself for the sins of his past. And every single pitch had led to this.<br> <br>The chance to be perfect. No hits, no walks, no one on base. Perfect.<br> <br>For the first time.<br> <br>What would his parents say after tonight? His father&#x2019;s face flashed in his mind. Funny. Whenever he thought of his dad, he thought of him angry. Correcting his pitching form, scrutinizing his weight training, questioning him.<br> <br>Another run scored and the Blue Wahoos were back in the outfield. Tyler felt warm and focused. More ready than ever. Jep Black&#x2019;s words from earlier that day ran through his head: &#x201c;Tonight&#x2019;s your night, Ames. Go out there and prove me right.&#x201d;<br> <br>Indeed.<br> <br>Jep had been talking to scouts from the Reds ever since the season started. Tonight, finally, the scouts were here. They actually wanted him. That&#x2019;s what Jep said. The Reds&#x2019; director of player personnel knew his name and his numbers. Every wonderful statistic from this season. Tyler was just what they were looking for. They even knew about his past.<br> <br>And they still wanted him.<br> <br>Tyler set his jacket on the bench and jogged out to the mound. On the way he stopped and talked to his catcher. &#x201c;More of the same.&#x201d; He brushed his glove against William&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Talk to me, Trap. Keep me perfect.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You got it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He reached the mound and glanced up. When was the last time a guy in the AA minor leagues threw a perfect game? The Pensacola faithful were on their feet. Tyler Ames was about to make history. They could feel it. This was their night as much as it was his.<br> <br>The beautiful oceanfront stadium had opened two years ago, and already it topped the list of places to see, things to do on the Florida Panhandle. The fans had bought into the Blue Wahoos, the team more than any individual player.<br> <br>But tonight was different. Tonight the Blue Wahoo fans loved Tyler Ames. They knew his name. He could hear them.<br> <br>Bottom of the lineup for the team from South Carolina. Easy as the waves in the bay, he thought. If only his parents could have been here tonight. If Sami could see how he&#x2019;d made good after all. He was going to be moved up to the big show. It was actually going to happen. Breathe, Ames . . . just breathe. He focused on William&#x2019;s glove. The batter was a washed-up second baseman from the Bigs who had been sent down to the AA leagues after an injury. He couldn&#x2019;t swing a bat the way he once had.<br> <br>Williams flashed him a signal. Tyler nodded. Yes, a fastball. That&#x2019;s exactly what he wanted. He lifted his knee and wound up the way he had ten thousand times. In a burst of motion he fired the ball over the plate. The batter didn&#x2019;t swing, didn&#x2019;t even have time to blink.<br> <br>&#x201c;Steee-rike!&#x201d; The umpire was getting excited, too.<br> <br>Tyler kept a straight face, but all around him it was happening. His teammates were behind him. He could feel the focus of his infield, feel the gloves of the outfield ready to react. He threw a slider and the batter connected. At the crack of the bat, Tyler&#x2019;s heart skipped a beat. He watched the trajectory overhead. Get it, he thought. Please get it. His teammate at centerfield responded. Fly out.<br> <br>One down. Still perfect.<br> <br>A grounder to first took care of the next batter. Tyler felt stronger now than he had at the beginning of the game. He settled himself on the mound and stared at the catcher. Change-up to start the batter. Tyler liked it. He wound up and caught the guy watching. Strike one. The second pitch was outside, same with the third.<br> <br>The fans at Bayfront Stadium fell to a hush. He couldn&#x2019;t throw another ball or the batter would walk. Breathe, Ames. He could be perfect. It would happen. He stared at William. His catcher signaled for a fastball. Tyler shook his head. Not for this batter. The guy had hit four home runs this month.<br> <br>Next he called for a curveball. Atta boy, William. Perfect pitch. Tyler gave the slightest nod. This was it. A curveball would sail straight toward the plate and break hard to the inside. By then the batter would bite, and the swing would be a strike.<br> <br>Another notch closer to perfection.<br> <br>Tyler settled back on his heels, glove up, ball in his hand. The windup was everything it needed to be. He uncoiled himself and released the ball just as he planned, like he&#x2019;d done all his life. But this time he heard something snap. Instantly fire ripped through his arm and down his torso, the sort of pain Tyler had never known before.<br> <br>&#x201c;Steee-rike!&#x201d; The umpire made the call.<br> <br>Tyler was already on the ground, writhing beneath the searing pain. The noise from the stadium dimmed and the only sounds were his racing heart and his own terrible groaning. People were running to him, but he couldn&#x2019;t hear them, couldn&#x2019;t make out their faces. He felt like demons were ripping his arm from his body. The world around him faded, every voice and face.<br> <br>The first uniformed medic reached him, a man Tyler had never seen before. He dropped to his knees and put his hand on Tyler&#x2019;s good shoulder. The guy looked like a linebacker. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>No! Tyler wanted to shout at him. But the pain was too great. I&#x2019;ll never be okay again. The man was staring at him, his eyes bright with something Tyler didn&#x2019;t recognize. Peace, maybe. Something otherworldly.<br> <br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t the end, Tyler.&#x201d; The medic&#x2019;s hand felt warm. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the beginning.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tyler shook his head. Angry tears filled his eyes. Of course it&#x2019;s the end. The name on the medic&#x2019;s uniform caught his attention. A name he&#x2019;d never heard before.<br> <br>Beck.<br> <br>Figures. Brand-new medic. What would he know? &#x201c;My . . . shoulder!&#x201d; The pain was killing him. Sweat dripped down his forehead and he could feel his body shaking, going into shock. Tyler lifted his eyes to the stadium lights. A strange darkness shrouded them and then gradually, everything else began to fade.<br> <br>Sami would never want him now. She would blame him for making the wrong choices all those years ago. I&#x2019;m sorry, Sami. I still love you. If you only knew how much. Two more medics with a stretcher rushed toward him, and the rest of the team gathered at a distance, silent, shocked. Tyler had one final thought before he blacked out.<br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t perfect.<br> <br>And after tonight he never would be.</p><h2>Answer As a Man</h2><p>An honest man faces personal disgrace and intimate betrayal as his marriage becomes a scandal, as he sees greed prevail over generosity, and as he resists the corruption that has engulfed his town</p><p></p><h2>The Gingerbread Man</h2><p>He escapes and eludes many animals until meeting a clever fox.</p><p>Run, run, as fast as you can and catch this version of the gingerbread man!

Happily, the last page shows a new cookie sheet lined with gingerbread men (and women), and the clever rhyme suggests that the gingerbread man bounces back from his unfortunate plight. "For gingerbread men return, it's said, / When someone bakes some gingerbread." Seasoned illustrator Megan Lloyd's flat and funny gingerbread man bounces along as cheerfully as the text.

They had one jumpseat passenger, an off-duty colleague who they assumed was simply taking advantage of the FedEx perk allowing virtually all employees to ride the company jet for free. The shock came twenty minutes later, before the plane had reached its normal cruising altitude.<br><br>The lone passenger attacked the pilots with hammers and a spear gun. He'd had his diabolical plan in the works for months: By crashing the plane into the Federal Express Memphis hub, he'd ruin the company, which he felt had treated him unfairly. With superhuman strength fueled by sheer fury, the attacker struck. What he didn't count on was the skill and intelligence of the pilots. While Sanders and Peterson tried to stop the relentless battering, copilot Tucker swung the aircraft into dangerous flight maneuvers in an attempt to literally knock the man off his feet. Covered in their own blood and exhausted from the struggle, the pilots finally managed to subdue their attacker, returning the plane safely back to Memphis as heroes.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>The gripping record of a ``routine'' Federal Express fast- freight flight between Memphis and San Jose in April 1994 that went horribly wrong. There were three crewmen on the DC-10 that night: David Sanders, the captain, a cool, 49-year-old pilot from west Texas; Jim Tucker, the copilot, a tall, powerful athlete; and Andy Anderson, a flight engineer from Mississippi. They had one passenger, Auburn Calloway, also a FedEx pilot, and a man with serious problems. An African-American, Calloway believed that he had been the object of racist harassment in the navy and at FedEx. The divorced Calloway, a karate expert, suspected that he was about to be fired and would thus be unable to provide for his two children. He drafted a will and, acting coolly and with caution, managed to hide hammers, a speargun, and a knife on the plane. He intended to kill the crew and crash the plane into a residential area, believing that the crash would be treated as an accident. Striking swiftly, he managed to assault Tucker and Anderson, fracturing their skulls. But they didn't lose consciousness and began fighting back. Tucker put the plane through a series of dizzying maneuvers, tossing the rest of the crew and Calloway about the cabin, causing Calloway to drop the speargun with which he had been attempting to kill Sanders. Hirschman, a reporter for the Memphis Commercial Appeal, provides a moment-by-moment reconstruction of the crew's long, bloody battle with Calloway. Bleeding, disoriented, weakening quickly, Tucker and Anderson nonetheless managed to restrain their assailant. Sanders, in great pain (Calloway had almost severed one of his ears in the initial attack) miraculously brought the plane into Memphis for a safe landing. Hirschman provides a summary of Calloway's trial. Convicted, he was sentenced to life in prison. A moving portrait of three quiet heroes. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>On April 7, 1994, two days before a scheduled disciplinary hearing, FedEx flight engineer Auburn Calloway joined the ranks of disgruntled employees who mix revenge with violence when he hijacked a DC-10 cargo jet en route from Memphis to San Jose. His plan to kill the crew and crash the plane backfired when the three-man crew--David Sanders (pilot), Jim Tucker (copilot), and Andy Peterson (flight engineer)--did not succumb to his brutal hammer blows to their skulls. With Tucker and Peterson in the cabin trying to subdue the agitated Calloway, Sanders landed the plane against heavy odds: the freight and fuel were too heavy, the approach speed was too fast, and parts of the plane had fallen off. Reporter and pilot Hirschman, who was on the story from the beginning, describes the thwarted hijacking; recovery of the injured airmen; and trial of Calloway. The bravery of the crewmen shines throughout as they saved the plane, the company, and the community from a major disaster. <i>Jennifer Henderson</i></p><h2>Mushrooms and Molds (Let&#39;s Read and Find Out Science Books)</h2><p>Describes mushrooms, molds, and other fungi and their function in the cycle of growing things.</p><p></p><h2>Radical Cities: Across Latin America in Search of a New Architecture</h2><p>What makes the city of the future? How do you heal a divided city? <br><br>In <i>Radical Cities,</i> Justin McGuirk travels across Latin America in search of the activist architects, maverick politicians and alternative communities already answering these questions. From Brazil to Venezuela, and from Mexico to Argentina, McGuirk discovers the people and ideas shaping the way cities are evolving. <br><br>Ever since the mid twentieth century, when the dream of modernist utopia went to Latin America to die, the continent has been a testing ground for exciting new conceptions of the city. An architect in Chile has designed a form of social housing where only half of the house is built, allowing the owners to adapt the rest; Medell�n, formerly the world&#x2019;s murder capital, has been transformed with innovative public architecture; squatters in Caracas have taken over the forty-five-story Torre David skyscraper; and Rio is on a mission to incorporate its favelas into the rest of the city. <br><br>Here, in the most urbanised continent on the planet, extreme cities have bred extreme conditions, from vast housing estates to sprawling slums. But after decades of social and political failure, a new generation has revitalised architecture and urban design in order to address persistent poverty and inequality. Together, these activists, pragmatists and social idealists are performing bold experiments that the rest of the world may learn from.<br><br><i>Radical Cities</i> is a colorful journey through Latin America&#x2014;a crucible of architectural and urban innovation.</p><p><b>Justin McGuirk</b> is a writer and curator, and has worked as the Guardian's design columnist and the editor of Icon magazine.

He focuses on the cutthroat competition and legislative and legal battles for control of New York's regional railways. The Eriethe eponymous Scarlet Womanwas the object of fierce speculation by the notorious confidence man Daniel Drew and such financial tycoons as "Jubilee" Jim Fisk and Gould, the latter's gold speculations having almost single-handedly caused the 1869 panic in the Street. By 1870, as competition for Chicago and Western rail connections became acute, a rate war instigated by Vanderbilt broke out between his New York Central and Erie. The assassination of the popular Fisk led to the violent ouster of his partner Gould from Erie's presidency, followed by a steady decline in the railroad's fortunes until its demise as a separate company in the early 1970s. Illustrations not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Railroads were America's first big business; their stock quickly caught the interest not only of prudent investors but of speculators intent on making a quick profit and selling out. Speculation in railroad stocks peaked between the end of the Civil War and the Panic of 1873; nobody was more successfulor ruthlessat manipulating the market than Gould, Fisk, and Vanderbilt, and no railroad was more thoroughly plundered than the hapless Erie. Gordon vividly chronicles this extravagant era, making extensive use of contemporary accounts; his treatment is fair, his writing graceful and witty. The bizarre and tragic Fisk is especially well portrayed. Good popular history; recommended. Paul B.

They used the materials around them, hair from mountain goats, and fibers from native plants such as Indian hemp and stinging nettle. Salish blankets and other weavings were collected by Captain James Cook on his expeditions to the northwest coast. Many are now in museums collections throughout the world. The Salish are known for their twill blankets. As the looms did not have heddles that could be raised, the twill designs were all hand-picked, the weft crossing the warp, over two and under two. The yarn was spun on spinning whorls made of wood or whalebone, measuring 3 to 6 inches in diameter. Some natural dyes were used, but the Salish preferred the texture of the twill weaves to elaborate designs. When other yarns became available through trade, the Salish adapted their traditional techniques to the new materials. Looms found at archaeological sites in the area measured 5 ft. in height and 6 ft. in width. Looms were warp frames, consisting of 2 upright sides embedded into the ground. Crossbars fit into carved slots on the sides. The lower crossbar could be loosened to release the tension. The warp was rolled forward as the weaving progressed. The crossbar was tightened and weaving continued</p><p></p><h2>Patricia Wells&#39; Trattoria</h2><p>Offering hearty food inspired by the small family restaurants of Italy, the award-winning author of Simply French presents 150 recipes for authentic and traditional trattoria food, including more than thirty pasta dishes. 100,000 first printing. $100,000 ad/promo.

Klagsburn, an author, editor and teacher, takes a fresh look at the cycle of the Jewish year, going beyond the holidays to include events and people that have shaped Jewish life. While she focuses on major and minor holidays and special observances, she also fills each month of the calendar with commemorative dates?the deaths of the matriarch Rachel and medieval philosopher Moses Maimonides, the establishment of the first ghetto in Venice and the completion of the Septuagint, the first Greek translation of the Torah. She defines the biblical and Talmudic framework of each holiday, explains customs, rituals and themes and adds layers of legend, debate and interpretation. Klagsburn's clear voice and thought-provoking entries make this scrupulously detailed resource a journal of the Jewish year and of Jewish life for both the uninformed and the informed. Podwal's obvious knowledge of Jewish sources colors his paintings with as much beauty as his palette; his witty black-and-white drawings bring to life the year's varying moods.

The sheer scale of it makes the measuring of America extraordinary. Beginning in 1785, it became the largest land survey in history stretching from the Ohio river to the Pacific coast and from Lake Erie to the Mexican border. It prepared the ground for the sale of almost two billion acres, and shaped landscapes and cities across the US more drastically than any event since the last ice age. Before the survey could begin, there had to be agreement about what kind of measurement should be used. What made the 18th-century debate so critical was the revolution taking place in Western thought as objective, scientific reasoning challenged the traditional, subjective view of the world. A battle began between those (like the British) supporting a centuries-old organic form of measurement (ounces and pounds, yards and acres) and the modernizers, like Thomas Jefferson, who backed a system based on scientific observation. The effects of the measuring of America on the landscape and people (native and immigrant) were huge and long-lasting.</p><p>Andro Linklater has been a writer for twenty years.

His nationality was unknown, but he'd once told Egan he was a little bit white, Mexican, Indian and black. With his long hair and a scar slashed down the side of his face, he was known to scare the strongest of men.<br><br>"Do you think that's wise?"<br><br>Jericho knew of the feud with the McCrays and that avoiding them was always the best policy.<br><br>Egan removed his rifle from the saddle scabbard. "Crazy Isadore McCray has dogs and I just want to see if they've crossed over onto Rebel land. If Izzy has been killing our calves, I'll call the sheriff. I don't plan on being stupid and confronting him. Stupid once in a lifetime is all I can handle."<br><br>"If the two of us track&#x2014;"<br><br>Egan cut him off with a dark stare. "I know these woods like the back of my hand and I don't need any help tracking. Tell Mom and Falcon I'm on it."<br><br>Jericho inclined his head. "You got it." He reached for the reins of Egan's horse. "But if you're not at the ranch by tomorrow, I'll come looking."<br><br>Egan nodded to his friend and squatted in front of Pete. "Go back to the ranch with Rico." He rubbed the dog's head. He didn't want the feral dogs to kill him. Pete was an Australian blue healer, a cow dog, but if it came to a fight, he would be right in the middle of it.<br><br>Tipping his hat, Jericho rode away, Pete trotting behind. The dog stopped once to look back, but Egan didn't motion for him to come, so he continued his journey behind the horses.<br><br>Egan shoved his hand into the pocket of his dark duster and pulled out his phone. No signal. He was alone, but it had been that way most of his life, even with six brothers.<br><br>Following the trail into the woods, he pushed through yaupons and mesquite. He kept his eyes focused on the ground. From the tracks, there had to be at least six dogs and one man. The woods grew thicker and the tracks disappeared, almost into thin air. He was close enough to the McCray property line to know Izzy had been up to no good. Egan may have told Rico he wouldn't do anything stupid, but he wasn't about to let Izzy kill any more calves on Rebel Ranch.<br><br>Rachel Hollister was lost.<br><br>For over an hour, she'd been traveling this country back road and the scenery had changed from mesquite and scrub to thick woods. She cursed herself for being a coward and taking the long way home. She'd been away twelve years and still she was stalling, avoiding the moment she would walk in the door of the home she'd shared with her mother and family. The mother who had died because of her. Twelve years was long enough to deal with the guilt. The grief. Or maybe not. It was part of her now.<br><br>Every morning when she looked in the mirror she saw herself, but she also saw a young girl who'd been spoiled, pampered and far too used to getting her own way. Rachel didn't like that girl and had had years to change her. But she hadn't changed enough to face the past. That was evident by her taking this cutoff to nowhere. If she'd stayed on US 77 she would already be in Horseshoe.<br><br>She'd left the blacktop some time ago and now the road narrowed to merely a track. Her heart lifted when she saw a cattle guard. There had to be a house somewhere and she could ask for directions. She looked around for signs of human life, a barn, anything. But all she saw were woods and more woods. The track ended and she had nowhere to go.<br><br>Just then the engine made a funny sound and she could barely turn the steering wheel. She stopped and listened. The motor was still running but the car wouldn't go. Now what?<br><br>She reached for her phone in her purse and tried to call her brother. No signal. She looked out the window and couldn't see power lines. Where was she? Rachel got out of the car and an eerie feeling came over her. The May wind rustled through the trees, the only sound she heard.<br><br>She tried her phone again. Nothing. A sliver of alarm shot through her and she got back into the car. How was she going to get out of here? She mustn't panic. She shut off the engine and waited ten minutes. When she started it again it sounded strange, not like before. She put the car in gear and pressed the gas. The steering wheel was still hard to turn and she knew she couldn't go very far like this. She turned off the ignition.<br><br>Her choices were simple. She'd have to walk out or sit here and wait for someone to find her. From the silence, she feared that wait might be long. A tear slipped from her eye and she slapped it away. She could handle this.<br><br>She got out of the car again and looked down at her dress and heels. Not ideal for walking. Her suitcase was in the backseat, so she'd just change into jeans and sneakers.<br><br>As Rachel moved toward the door, something in her peripheral vision caught her eye. Her heart thumped against her chest. There was a man emerging from the woods. He was hard to see because he seemed as one with his surroundings. A dark duster like she'd seen cowboys wear in olden days flapped around his legs. His longish dark hair brushed against his collar, and he had at least a day's worth of stubble. A worn hat was pulled low over his eyes, but what held her attention was the rifle in his hand.<br><br>Fear crept along her nerves as she got back into the car, locking the doors manually. The man continued to stride toward her. There was nothing she could do but wait. Who was he? And what was he doing out here so far from anywhere?<br><br>Her eyes were glued to him as he drew closer. She scooted away from the window, as if that would help. When he tapped on the window, she jumped; she was so nervous.<br><br>"Are you okay, ma'am?"<br><br>He peered at her through the window and she stared into the darkest eyes she'd ever seen. Instead of being paralyzed with fear, her body relaxed. His eyes were riveting. It was like coming in from an icy cold day into a room with a roaring fire. All she felt was the warmth, and she instinctively knew this man wouldn't hurt her.<br><br>"Ma'am, are you okay?" he repeated, and his strong voice propelled her into action. She turned on the motor and reached for the window button, but nothing happened. The window wouldn't move. She had no choice but to open the door.<br><br>As she got out, he stepped back and she realized he was tall. Even in her heels she had to look up.<br><br>"What are you doing out here?" His voice was deep, masculine and irritated.<br><br>"I'm lost," she admitted. "I was headed to Horseshoe."<br><br>"You're miles away from Horseshoe."<br><br>She knew that. "I was hoping to find a house and get directions, but there don't seem to be any homes nearby."<br><br>"No." He pointed. "Across that fence line is the McCray property and you're standing on Rebel Ranch. The cattle guard is a back entrance in case we need it. If you turn around and follow the track, it will lead you to a road. You should be able to find your way then."<br><br>"That's the problem. Something's wrong with my car. It started making funny noises and now I can't turn the steering wheel. And the windows won't work, either." She looked into those beautiful eyes. "Do you know anything about cars?"<br><br>He placed his rifle against the vehicle. "Unlatch the hood and I'll take a look."<br><br><i>Unlatch the hood?</i> "Uh..." She had no idea what he was talking about, and it was no use pretending that she did. "This is a rental and I don't know anything about cars."<br><br>He didn't roll his eyes or anything like that. He just reached inside her car and pulled something. A pop sounded. He walked to the front of the car and with both hands lifted the hood. Peering over, she watched as he looked around.<br><br>He finally straightened. "Your serpentine belt is broken. It controls a lot of the extras on your car, like power steering, power windows and AC. I'm not sure about this model, but it can also control the water pump, which means driving could be dangerous." He slammed the hood shut.<br><br>"Do you live nearby?" she asked with a hopeful note.<br><br>"Miles away. I'm out tracking feral dogs."<br><br>"What?" Had she heard him correctly? She had this eerie feeling she'd stepped back into the 1800s.<br><br>"Dogs are killing our calves on the ranch." When he sensed she wasn't following him, he waved his hand. "You can just follow the track to the road. It'll take you an hour or so, but someone will eventually find you."<br><br>She looked down at her heels.<br><br>"Do you have other shoes?" That note of irritation was back in his voice.<br><br>"In my suitcase."<br><br>"My suggestion is you change and start moving, because it's going to be dark soon."<br><br>The thought of walking alone at night filled her with a claustrophobic feeling. "I really don't want to walk alone. I'll pay you if you help me get to Horseshoe."<br><br>He sighed. "Ma'am, I don't need your money. I just need to get back to doing my job before any more calves die on the ranch."<br><br>"You can't just leave me out here. I know there are wild animals and no telling what else. It's dangerous."<br><br>"And that didn't cross your mind when you were traveling miles and miles without a sign of life?"<br><br>"I was looking for Cutoff 149."<br><br>"They changed that many years ago. The roads now have county numbers so it's easier for emergency vehicles and firefighters."<br><br>"It's been a long time since I've been to Horseshoe."<br><br>"Then why not stay on 77?"<br><br>He was annoyed and he was making <i>her</i> annoyed. She placed her hands on her hips. "Are you going to help me or not?"<br><br>He glanced off to the woods and then at her. "Looks like I don't have any choice, and I lost the tracks a while ago. If we walk directly east, it should take about two hours to reach a spot where we can get cell phone reception. Then I can call the ranch and someone can meet us in an all-terrain vehicle. Change clothes. I'll give you a few minutes." He strolled away without a backward glance.<br><br>Goose bumps popped up on her skin. He wouldn't leave her here, would he? Her gut instinct said no. She didn't know anything about him, but she sensed he was a man she could trust. Climbing into the backseat, she took a long breath and did a quick change. She felt like Houdini.<br><br>This was all her fault and she was angry at herself. She was glad she hadn't called her father or her brother to let them know she was coming home. They would be worried sick when she didn't show up. Now they were really going to be surprised. How could one day go so wrong?<br><br>Egan gave the woman a few minutes, wondering how he'd gotten himself into this mess. He didn't have time to fool with some ditzy blonde. Being judgmental wasn't part of his nature, so he should give the woman the benefit of the doubt. But she was far from civilization and it was going to take a big chunk out of his workday to help her. It all depended on how fast she could walk. If he had to guess, he would say it was going to be a slow go.<br><br>When he returned to the car, she was standing outside. He took one look and wondered if this woman had any sense at all. She wore short jeans. They had a name, but for the life of him he couldn't think of it. She had a pink-and-white layered top and pink-and-white sneakers.<br><br>He motioned toward the jeans. "Do you have longer ones?"<br><br>"No. It's spring so I brought spring and summer clothes. These are capris."<br><br>"And unsuitable for hiking through the woods."<br><br>Her face crumpled like a little kid's and he thought she was going to cry. "It's all I have besides shorts and another dress."<br><br>"It will have to do. Do you have a long-sleeved blouse or a sweater? It'll get chilly in these hills as it grows darker."<br><br>"I have a lime-green lightweight sweater that goes with my dress, but it doesn't match what I have on."<br><br>He laughed. He couldn't help himself. He'd gotten himself involved with a city diva.</p><h2>Vincent Van Gogh: Letters from Provence</h2><p>Moving story of Van Gogjs last years through his own words and pictures</p><p></p><h2>You Wouldn&#39;t Want to Explore With Marco Polo!: A Really Long Trip You&#39;d Rather Not Take</h2><p>Examines for young readers the long and arduous journey to the Far East taken by Marco Polo and his companions, which took more than 20 years to complete and included extreme travel conditions, hostile armies and strange animals.

After a former lover of Gordon's is first accused of attacking, and then murdering, prominent citizen and vocal anti-Brownlow Common activist Rupert Crabtree, Gordon finds herself embroiled in an investigation with far-reaching implications. These extend far beyond the women's peace movement, all the way up to the highest levels of Her Majesty's government.<br>In the course of solving a crime that some authorities are determined to pin on a community of women activists, Gordon is forced to confront all the contradictions in her life: her personal loyalties as a friend and a lover, her political convictions as a working-class lesbian, her professional responsibilities as a journalist, and her civil obligations as an English subject.<br>As she works her way through the tangle of personal conflicts and state secrets that led to Crabtree's murder, Lindsay Gordon discovers, sometimes to her own surprise, what concessions she can make in her life and what things are beyond compromise.</p><p>Val McDermid grew up in a Scottish mining community then read English at Oxford. She was a journalist for sixteen years, spending the last three as Northern Bureau Chief of a national Sunday tabloid. She is now a full-time writer and lives in South Manchester.Lesbian reporter Lindsay Gordon goes to cover the long protest of a cruise missile base by a British women's peace encampment and finds there an attractive ex-lover who is accused of murder, not to mention routine assaults and an official cover-up. Although the book's plot is sometimes contrived and the pacing is uneven, Gordon is a gutsy heroine committed to action, righting wrongs, and solving mysteries who sometimes takes large helpings of abuse and plays both sides of the allegiance fence in order to succeed. As she battles to solve the problems of a monogamous relationship against a background of institutionalized secrecy, lies, and brutality, the author gives readers a strong sense of contemporary England, too. <i>Whitney Scott</i></p><h2>The Earth Moves: Galileo and the Roman Inquisition (Great Discoveries)</h2><p><p><strong>A cogent portrayal of the beginnings of modern science and a turning point in the evolution of the freedom of thought.</strong></p> Celebrated, controversial, condemned, Galileo Galilei is a seminal figure in the history of science. Both Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein credit him as the first modern scientist. His 1633 trial before the Holy Office of the Inquisition is the prime drama in the history of the conflict between science and religion. In Galileo&#x2019;s day, Rome was the capital of a sovereign theocratic power, which in 1600 had executed Giordano Bruno on similar charges and reserved the right to torture Galileo.Galileo was then sixty-nine years old and the most venerated scientist in Italy. Although subscribing to an anti-literalist view of the Bible, as per Saint Augustine, Galileo considered himself a believing Catholic.Playing to his own strengths&#x2015;a deep knowledge of Italy, a longstanding interest in Renaissance and Baroque lore&#x2015;Dan Hofstadter explains apparent paradoxes and limns this historic moment in the widest cultural context, portraying Galileo as both humanist and scientist.26 illustrations</p><p>Dan Hofstadter is the author of The Earth Moves and Falling Palace: A Romance of Naples (a finalist for the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for the Art of the Memoir). He has lived in Florence and Naples and speaks and reads Italian fluently. He lives in Rensselaerville, New York.Hofstadter (Falling Palace: A Romance of Naples) draws upon his intimate knowledge of Italian culture, literature and art-as well as new material released from Vatican archives-for this political, scientific and psychological examination of the "first great clash of religion and science," between Galileo and Pope Urban VIII, two seminal figures who were, incredibly, once friends. The context for Galileo's 1633 trial involved political and scientific upheavals involving better technology (Galileo's major improvements on the telescope) and a 1616 Church edict against heliocentrism meant to protect the Scripture from the free interpretation of laypeople. Despite the political cost, Galileo produced a philosophic treatise on the subject, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems (originally licensed for publication by the Church) that championed the "banned hypothesis thesis" and suggested that astronomical references in scripture were metaphorical. Hofstadter tells the concise, absorbing tale of Galileo's persecution with both sides of the conflict in mind, charting with grace the genesis of the Western world's most persistent ideological divide. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But while authors Pierce and Rowland - both mothers of young children - were able to find Catholic material for older children, they realized there was very little for small folk. Their combined efforts in this book should help fill that void, by offering practical day-to-day suggestions for Catholic child faith development. To teach one to see beyond the external comes from a persistent spiritual frame of reference. It builds on inherited tendencies and redirects behavioral patterns. The authors makes spiritual things fun and have &#34;simplified&#34; the mysteries of the Catholic Faith in a way that toddlers can assimilate at their level, and love doing it. The book offers hundreds of helps, but basically confirms that children are intrinsically religious if only the opportunities are offered.</p><p></p><h2>Death in Stanley Street</h2><p>Detective Wycliffe&#39;s investigation of the strangling of prostitute Lily Painter leads to discoveries about her influential puritanical father, her real estate business, and the men in her life</p><p></p><h2>Tek Lab</h2><p>Investigator Jake Cardigan enters the blasted ruins of twenty-first century London to search for his missing son and invades the underground turf of the TekLords. Reprint.</p><p>This third futuristic crime adventure by Star Trek's Shatner (TekWar, 1989; TekLords, p. 571) displays the same cardboard characterization, predictable plotting, and lackluster prose as before. Once again, private detectives Jake Cardigan and Sid Gomez tangle with the nefarious international dealers of Tek, a mind- altering electronic ``drug.'' The case this time begins with a grisly murder in the style of an elusive serial killer, the Unknown Soldier, but Jake and Gomez have reason to believe it was really the work of the Tek cartels; and through a series of unlikely contrivances and convenient informants, the detectives uncover a plot that links the Tek dealers to a conspiracy (believe it or not!) to restore the banished monarchy to power in England. Along the way, Jake's son Dan, Dan's girlfriend Nancy, and Jake's ex-wife Kate get involved, and the whole family heads for a climatic conclusion aboard a luxury resort satellite, the Caribbean Colony. Shatner's future world is as generic and unconvincing as his characters, and the fast-paced action that carried the other Jake Cardigan adventures is tired and limp here. If this is where Shatner's writing career is headed, one wishes he would return to TV. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In their third adventure (after Teklords ) set in the 22nd century, private detective Jack Cardigan and sidekick Sid Gomez are once again fighting the evil and omnipotent Teklords. A serial killer who calls himself the Unknown Soldier is stalking and executing people whom he perceives as war criminals. The wife of the latest victim thinks her husband was murdered by a copycat assassin at Teklord command, and she hires the detectives to find the Teklord killer. The story goes rapidly downhill as the villains, miraculously aware of the detectives' plans, calmly kill off the witnesses but only try to scare Cardigan away. Nor is the reader distracted from the flaws in the plot by the depiction of earth in 2120: a sprinkling of buzzwords does not paint a foreign culture. There are so many cameo appearances and short sidetracks that all tension is drained from the main story line. What little resolution there is comes not from the efforts of the heroes but from unmotivated mistakes on the part of the Teklords. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Wiles of War 36 Military Strategies from Ancient China</h2><p>The present book offers a precise translation of the title and text of each strategy.

Under what conditions is it appropriate, or necessary, for a country to use force when diplomacy has failed? Michael Byers, a widely known world expert on international law, weighs these issues in <i>War Law</i> . Byers examines the history of armed conflict and international law through a series of case studies of past conflicts, ranging from the 1837 Caroline Incident to the abuse of detainees by U.S. forces at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Byers explores the legal controversies that surrounded the 1999 and 2001 interventions in Kosovo and Afghanistan and the 2003 war in Iraq; the development of international humanitarian law from the 1859 Battle of Solferino to the present; and the role of war crimes tribunals and the International Criminal Court. He also considers the unique influence of the United States in the evolution of this extremely controversial area of international law. <i>War Law</i> is neither a textbook nor a treatise, but a fascinating account of a highly controversial topic that is necessary reading for fans of military history and general readers alike.</p><p>Michael Byers is the Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the University of British Columbia, Canada. He is the author of Custom, Power and the Power of Rules, the editor of The Role of Law in International Politics, and a regular contributor to the London Review of Books.When President Bush insists our military forces have acted in accordance with international law, many other nations disagree. This happens so often that observers may wonder: exactly what laws are they arguing about? To readers willing to put in the work, this dense book provides the answers. According to Byers (<i>The Role of Law in International Politics</i>), laws governing war have existed since the 19th century, but nations freely disregarded them until the adoption of the U.N. Charter in 1945. The charter itself, however, is still subject to interpretation. When Israeli planes bombed an Iraqi nuclear facility in 1981, for example, the U.S. insisted that pre-emptive self-defense was not sanctioned. By 2003, America had changed its mind. Byers devotes three chapters to the complicated issue of self-defense, and another three to the equally contentious issue of humanitarian intervention: i.e., whether it's okay to invade a nation to stop it from committing unspeakable acts, such as genocide, or to bring democracy to its people. A final chapter attacks recent U.S. foreign policy, which, Byers argues, places American interests above international law and returns the world to the pre-1945 era when powerful nations routinely threw their weight around the globe, often with terrible consequences. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Eminent botanist Philibert Commerson had just been appointed to a grand new expedition: the first French circumnavigation of the world. As the ships&#x2019; official naturalist, Commerson would seek out resources&#x2014;medicines, spices, timber, food&#x2014;that could give the French an edge in the ever-accelerating race for empire.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jeanne Baret, Commerson&#x2019;s young mistress and collaborator, was desperate not to be left behind. She disguised herself as a teenage boy and signed on as his assistant. The journey made the twenty-six-year-old, known to her shipmates as &#x201c;Jean&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;Jeanne,&#x201d; the first woman to ever sail around the globe. Yet so little is known about this extraordinary woman, whose accomplishments were considered to be subversive, even impossible for someone of her sex and class.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>When the ships made landfall and the secret lovers disembarked to explore, Baret carried heavy wooden field presses and bulky optical instruments over beaches and hills, impressing observers on the ships&#x2019; decks with her obvious strength and stamina. Less obvious were the strips of linen wound tight around her upper body and the months she had spent perfecting her masculine disguise in the streets and marketplaces of Paris.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Expedition commander Louis-Antoine de Bougainville recorded in his journal that curious Tahitian natives exposed Baret as a woman, eighteen months into the voyage. But the true story, it turns out, is more complicated.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>The Discovery of Jeanne Baret, </i>Glynis Ridley unravels the conflicting accounts recorded by Baret&#x2019;s crewmates to piece together the real story: how Baret&#x2019;s identity was in fact widely suspected within just a couple of weeks of embarking, and the painful consequences of those suspicions; the newly discovered notebook, written in Baret&#x2019;s own hand, that proves her scientific acumen; and the thousands of specimens she collected, most famously the showy vine bougainvillea.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ridley also richly explores Baret&#x2019;s awkward, sometimes dangerous interactions with the men on the ship, including Baret&#x2019;s lover, the obsessive and sometimes prickly naturalist; a fashion-plate prince who, with his elaborate wigs and velvet garments, was often mistaken for a woman himself; the sour ship&#x2019;s surgeon, who despised Baret and Commerson; even a Tahitian islander who joined the expedition and asked Baret to show him how to behave like a Frenchman.<br>&nbsp;<br>But the central character of this true story is Jeanne Baret herself, a working-class woman whose scientific contributions were quietly dismissed and written out of history&#x2014;until now. Anchored in impeccable original research and bursting with unforgettable characters and exotic settings, <i>The Discovery of Jeanne Baret </i>offers this forgotten heroine a chance to bloom at long last.</p><p>GLYNIS RIDLEY is the author of <i>Clara&#x2019;s Grand Tour: Travels with a Rhinoceros in Eighteenth-Century Europe, </i>which won the Institute of Historical Research (University of London) Prize.

Each of the more than eighty essays takes a key date as its starting point and explores its significance for German film history, pursuing its relationship with its social, political, and aesthetic moment. While the essays offer ample temporal and topical spread, this book emphasizes the juxtaposition of famous and unknown stories, granting attention to a wide range of cinematic events. Brief section introductions provide a larger historical and film-historical framework that illuminates the essays within it, offering both scholars and the general reader a setting for the individual texts and figures under investigation. Cross-references to other essays in the book are included at the close of each entry, encouraging readers not only to pursue familiar trajectories in the development of German film, but also to trace particular figures and motifs across genres and historical periods. Together, the contributions offer a new view of the multiple, intersecting narratives that make up German-language cinema. The constellation that is thus established challenges unidirectional narratives of German film history and charts new ways of thinking about film historiography more broadly.

Admitting that Romans is often difficult for Christians to read because of its focus on God's wrath and God's punishment of human sinfulness, Lucado translates and interprets the biblical texts to demonstrate that God's righteousness and justice are merely indicators of the mercy and lovingkindness inherent in God's grace. Through these readings, Lucado reminds readers of the eternal quality of God's mercy and the gentleness of his love. While Lucado's book is not a compendium of deep theological insights, his graceful style and his thorough exposition of biblical texts will grant rewards to interested readers. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Story of the Jamaican People</h2><p>The last general history of Jamaica was published in 1960. Since then the country has become an independent nation and has developed a new sense of national identity out of the experience of 450 years of European colonization, African slavery, and the transplanting of immigrant populations from India, China, Lebanon, and Syria. <p>The Jamaican people have never accepted what was presented to them as the history of Jamaica. The heroes of the British Empire are not their heroes, and their battlefields are in Jamaica, the Caribbean and Afro-America, wherever Afro-American freedom fighters have struggled for liberty. A new interpretation of the Jamaican experience is long overdue. In this book, Sir Philip Sherlock teams up with documentarian Dr. Hazel Bennett to tell the story of the Jamaican people from an Afro-Jamaican rather than a European perspective. Africa is at the center of the story; by claiming Africa as homeland, Jamaicans gain a sense of historical continuity, of identity, of roots-an experience they share with fifty million Afro-Americans throughout the Americas and across four centuries. </p><p>This is a book for the 1990s and beyond; for the present generation and generations to come; for Jamaicans at home and abroad; and for all Afro-Americans who are descendants of the great diaspora.</p></p><p>Hazel Bennett is a former head of the Department of Library Studies at the University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica.The Story of the Jamaican People <p>The historiography of Jamaica has come a long way, from Fernando Henrique's Jamaica, Land of Wood and Water (1964), in which blacks are categorized with the plantation stock, to Sherlock and Bennett's The Story of the Jamaican People (1998), in which they are treated as being among the founders of civilization. Unlike other histories of the island published since emancipaton (see, for example, Black 1965; Hurwitz &amp; Hurwitz 1971; Gardner 1971), The Story of Jamaican People is not in the typical genre of a colonial history; it is a history of a people. </p><p>Yet the book presents a picture of Jamaica that is both bleak and bright. It is written to inspire Jamaicans, but it also condemns the horrible plantation regime upon which the nation, indeed the region, was founded. The modern history of the region began with an error of navigation and was nurtured on greed, cruelty, and cultural arrogance. For blacks the outcome was, in the words of George Lamming, "a fractured conciousness" (p. 294). Jamaica's history began in a portentous unequalness, symbolically and actually represented in Cristobal Col�n and his band of conquistadores trading worthless curios with the native Tainos for their finely crafted implements. The journey through the centuries brought this small isle to envision itself as a nation "fitted by its record of cultural achievement to contribute significantly to the unity and happiness of our [global] shipmates" (p.411). Situated ambiguously as it has been at the center of modern history but on the peripheries of international relations of power, Jamaica is still navigating its way through the contradictions conceived in the Col�n-Taino trade. </p><p>The story pivots on the theme of the creation of a unified nation out of conflicting interests and understandings. Jamaica's flat lands permitted industrial-scale plantations, but the mountains have always embraced escapees. Control by a small number of absentee white plantation owners contributed to brutal neglect of the island, but the large numbers of black imported laborers facilitated generalized revolt. The maroons fought valiantly for their freedom, but later collaborated with planters against run-away slaves to maintain that freedom. Adjustment to servitude and post-plantation oppression has always kindled divisive violence in the very people known for their cooperative spirit and eternal warmth. For much of this history, Jamaica was, as the authors remark, not a nation but a name; no one called Jamaica home (p. 156). The contradictions germinated the dialectical seed of nationhood, however- a process of self-formation born in the tumultuous days of urban proletarian protest of the 1930's and coming of age in the nationalist decolonization struggles of the 1950's and 1960's. </p><p>The very first line of the book's introduction establishes its tone: "In this book the authors tell the story of the Jamaican from an African-Jamaican, not a European, point of view: (p. xi). They then quickly go on to argue that "the Jamaican people have never accepted what was presented to them as the history of Jamaica. The Heroes of the British Empire are not their heroes. Their battlefields are in African-America, in Palmares...in Accompong" (p. xi). This sets the stage for grounding the story in Africa-"the homeland." But this grounding is less strictly historiographic than vaguely cosmological, what locals might call a "navel string" grounding. </p><p>The titles of the first three chapers- "Honour the Ancestors," "On Claiming our Great Heritage," and "Africa, the Original Homeland"- are not only accurately descriptive of content, but intended to be evocative of a rebellion in historical consciousness. The authors tell us that this history begins with a tribute of loving respect for the Jamaican and West Indian people, and quote George Lamming on his desire to bring "this world of men and women from down below to a proper order of attention" (p.1). But lest the reader begin to think this work is blind to non-African Jamaica, they immediately move to recognize the coming of the Jews as early as the sixteenth century, and later the Indians, Chinese, Lebanese, and Syrians. And the three historical icons venerated for their inspiration in nation building are George Washinton, Sim�n Bol�var, and Toussaint L'Ouverture. </p><p>Chapter 4 begins the conceptual task of replacing The "colonial model" of Jamaican history and society with a "world perspective", and Chapter 5, less than eight pages, begins the empirical grounding of this world perspective with a consideration of the indigenous peoples of the region. The story then shifts to the coming of those entities, Spain and Britain, whose single-minded attention to gain would necessarily distort and obscure the story of those whose labor produced than gain. Ultimately, the heritage that is claimed is the heritage of slave rebellions, maroon wars, and postslavery struggles for freedom under leaders from Paul Bogle to Bob Marley. But it is also the heritage of "freedom and justice to be found in English history" and encoded in the Magna Carta. </p><p>The story soon turns from attention to heritage, honor, and homeland to consideration of colonial creation. The authors self-consciously place their narrative firmly in a global perspective, wider than the colonial world which has so typically framed our historical thinking. Branding this the "long view of African and human history" (p. 33), they begin with the hunting and gathering peoples of the early period and move on to the settled centers of "civilization" such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, and China. The intent is to eschew what they appropriately see as the "fracturing influences of imperial Europe," and to endgender instead a sense of the essential unity of humanity. Buried in this schema is an all too simplified, even distorting, unilinear evolution. </p><p>The heart of the book- Chapters 6 through 29- retells the story of conquest, settlement, the emergence of a profoundly divided society, the birth of nationalist consciousness in the late 1930's to 1940's, and the beginning of economic development thinking in the 1950's to 1960's. The final chapter, "Culture and Nationhood," pulls together a wide spectrum of events and individual accomplishments pertaining to art, politics, and performance, in order to underscore that nation-building is as much culture-building as institution-building. Above all, the story of nation-building is about how African Jamaicans rejected the plantation and post-plantaion systems and, at the same time, adjusted with ferocity, ingenuity, long suffering, and humor. To use a Jamaican saying, they are able to tek' bad somt'ing mek' laugh. </p><p>Where the book soars is not in recounting the major wars and rebellions (about which much has already been written- for example, Hart 1985; Holt 1992), but in the telling of the human side of the struggle, the everyday creativity of the folk in overcoming adversity. Here the authors show deep knowledge and sensitive appreciation of local culture, drawing heavily, as no Jamaican historian before them has done, on popular expressive idioms. The technique brings to mind E.P. Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class - not so much for its grand theoretical intent and fine-grained ethnohistorical research, but with the same common-people-as-historical-agents effect. In that vein, the struggle of Jamaican plantation and post-plantation workers is put in the broader historical context of the development of the English working class in response to the demands of the Industrial Revolution. </p><p>The book's significance lies less in the impressive synthesis it achieves than in the modality of its interpretation: the African-Jamaican perspective. Two discursive vehicles used to enable this perspective deserve critical comment: the emphasis on liberation of consciousness, and the wide use of local sociocultural material. The authors raise the question: "Why do Jamaicans avert their eyes from their history, when in all countries the teaching of history is an opportunity to build up a basic nationalism and patriotism in the mind of a child" (p. 8). They answer this question by presenting a history which seems intended less to provide academic historians with a paradigmatic shift- though it may serve that purpose- than to provide an intellectual balm yard, a rallying point for revitalizing national consciousness. It is, in a phrase, a transparently nationalist history. </p><p>By contextualizing the Jamaican story as part of the "long view of African and Human history," we get a sense of Jamaicans not as mere survivors of European avarice and arrogance, but as mindful historical agents. Thus, we are treated to a humanist interweaving of ideas and activities from abolitionists William Wilberforce and Granville Sharp to black Baptist missionaries George Lisle and Moses Baker; from nineteenth-century Jamaican activist George William Cordon to ex-slave Paul Bogle; and from nativist religious leader Bedward to today's Rastafarian activists. Politics and religion are treated as unified. The effect of Voltaire's play, Saul, and Rousseau's Social Contract, are viewed alongside the declaration of a local hymn, "Since Christ Has Made Us Free," in their synthesized effect on local and regional liberatory history. </p><p>This book's inspiring and accessible telling of Jamaican history is a significant contribution to the emergent thinking that challenges the categories of thought and knowledge bequeathed under the twin yoke of greed and cultural arrogance. The real beneficiaries of this bold intellectual labor of love and respect for a people will be secondary and postsecondary students, who will find in it a history that speaks not just to their intellect but to their spirit as well. -- <i>Book Review</i></p></p><h2>Tiffany Christmas</h2><p>A lavishly illustrated guide overflowing with photographs of opulent table settings and decorations collected by Tiffany &amp; Company also offers holiday stories, craft ideas, historical vignettes, recipes, and tips on entertaining in the Tiffany style.</p><p>John Loring is the design director of Tiffany &amp; Co.</p><h2>Cleaving: A Story of Marriage, Meat, and Obsession</h2><p>Julie Powell thought cooking her way through Julia Child's <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i> was the craziest thing she'd ever do--until she embarked on the voyage recounted in her new memoir, CLEAVING.<br><br>Her marriage challenged by an insane, irresistible love affair, Julie decides to leave town and immerse herself in a new obsession: butchery. She finds her way to Fleischer's, a butcher shop where she buries herself in the details of food.

At the end of her odyssey, she has learned a new art and perhaps even mastered her unruly heart.</p><p>After a misspent youth involving loads of dead-end jobs and several questionable decisions, <strong>Julie Powell</strong>, author of <em>Julie &amp; Julia--</em>made into a major motion picture by Nora Ephron starring Meryl Streep and Amy Adams--has found her calling as a writer-cum-butcher. She lives in Long Island City, Queens, when she isn't in Kingston, NY, cutting up animals.Listeners looking for some continuation of Powell's hugely successful JULIE &amp; JULIA may not find it in this memoir. The subtitle of "Marriage, Meat and Obsession" sums up the book well, and with her audio presentation the obsession part seems to dominate. To distract herself from her disintegrating marriage, Powell learns the art of butchery, which she takes up with compulsive energy. In turn, much of her hard-edged manic focus is conveyed in the audio. She definitely TELLS listeners her story, with a demanding, self-centered tone. Listeners can learn a good deal about butchery but may get more than TMI about her marriage and adultery. The people and culture of Fleischer's butcher shop are interesting, but Powell's narration creates a barrier to real understanding. It all has to be about Julie.

Stated first edition, price clipped.</p><p>Taylor Caldwell (1900&#x2013;1985) was one of the most prolific and widely read authors of the twentieth century. Born Janet Miriam Holland Taylor Caldwell in Manchester, England, she moved with her family to Buffalo, New York, in 1907. She started writing stories when she was eight years old and completed her first novel when she was twelve. Married at age eighteen, Caldwell worked as a stenographer and court reporter to help support her family and took college courses at night, earning a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Buffalo in 1931. She adopted the pen name Taylor Caldwell because legendary editor Maxwell Perkins thought her debut novel, <i>Dynasty of Death </i>(1938), would be better received if readers assumed it were written by a man. In a career that spanned five decades, Caldwell published forty novels, many of which were <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers. Her best-known works include the historical sagas <i>The Sound of Thunder </i>(1957), <i>Testimony of Two Men </i>(1968), <i>Captains and the Kings </i>(1972), and <i>Ceremony of the Innocent </i>(1976), and the spiritually themed novels <i>The Listener </i>(1960) and <i>No One Hears But Him </i>(1966). <i>Dear and Glorious Physician </i>(1958), a portrayal of the life of St. Luke, and <i>Great Lion of God</i> (1970), about the life of St. Paul, are among the bestselling religious novels of all time. Caldwell&#x2019;s last novel, <i>Answer as a Man</i> (1981), hit the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list before its official publication date. She died at her home in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1985.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Beautifully written&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Surprise, surprise: instead of scandal, Manning finds a community of heartwarming characters and his own personal salvation. This debut novel, aimed at LDS insiders, probably intends to provide some knowing chuckles about Mormon culture and warm affirmations of the gospel, but the story is mired in amateur writing. Call goes overboard in painting the "ruggedly handsome" Manning as a man of the world: his columns and articles are read by millions, he dates swimsuit models, derails political careers, lunches regularly with celebrities and is "on a first-name basis with the mayor and every other influential public figure" in Manhattan. Manning's gradual transformation in Utah is forced and lacks credibility. His infatuation with the ravishing returned missionary Hayley Woodard feels adolescent, and his willingness to take in a homeless man before restoring him to his family is far-fetched. Call's prose is plodding and mechanical, with only superficial plot development. Every purported scandal Manning discovers predictably proves to be quite the opposite. He also occasionally hijacks scenes to deliver sermons on LDS culture. At least the book is punctuated with a few humorous bright spots. Call successfully captures the quirkiness of Mormon testimony meetings and has fun with the inevitable oddballs who people any LDS ward. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.As you read this book, you will have an unsurpassed amusing, emotional and spiritual experience. -- <i>George Durrant, author</i></p><h2>Mole!
